  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re describing the sound of your faulty car engine or meowing like your neighbor’s cat, imitating sounds with your voice can be a helpful way to relay a concept when words don’t do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocal imitation is the sonic equivalent of doodling a quick picture to communicate something you saw — except that instead of using a pencil to illustrate an image, you use your vocal tract to express a sound. This might seem difficult, but it’s something we all do intuitively: To experience it for yourself, try using your voice to mirror the sound of an ambulance siren, a crow, or a bell being struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the cognitive science of how we communicate, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) researchers have developed an AI system that can produce human-like vocal imitations with no training, and without ever having "heard" a human vocal impression before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the researchers engineered their system to produce and interpret sounds much like we do. They started by building a model of the human vocal tract that simulates how vibrations from the voice box are shaped by the throat, tongue, and lips. Then, they used a cognitively-inspired AI algorithm to control this vocal tract model and make it produce imitations, taking into consideration the context-specific ways that humans choose to communicate sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model can effectively take many sounds from the world and generate a human-like imitation of them — including noises like leaves rustling, a snake’s hiss, and an approaching ambulance siren. Their model can also be run in reverse to guess real-world sounds from human vocal imitations, similar to how some computer vision systems can retrieve high-quality images based on sketches. For instance, the model can correctly distinguish the sound of a human imitating a cat’s “meow” versus its “hiss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, this model could potentially lead to more intuitive “imitation-based” interfaces for sound designers, more human-like AI characters in virtual reality, and even methods to help students learn new languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-lead authors — MIT CSAIL PhD students Kartik Chandra SM ’23 and Karima Ma, and undergraduate researcher Matthew Caren — note that computer graphics researchers have long recognized that realism is rarely the ultimate goal of visual expression. For example, an abstract painting or a child’s crayon doodle can be just as expressive as a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the past few decades, advances in sketching algorithms have led to new tools for artists, advances in AI and computer vision, and even a deeper understanding of human cognition,” notes Chandra. “In the same way that a sketch is an abstract, non-photorealistic representation of an image, our method captures the abstract, non-phono&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;realistic ways humans express the sounds they hear. This teaches us about the process of auditory abstraction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art of imitation, in three parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed three increasingly nuanced versions of the model to compare to human vocal imitations. First, they created a baseline model that simply aimed to generate imitations that were as similar to real-world sounds as possible — but this model didn’t match human behavior very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then designed a second “communicative” model. According to Caren, this model considers what’s distinctive about a sound to a listener. For instance, you’d likely imitate the sound of a motorboat by mimicking the rumble of its engine, since that’s its most distinctive auditory feature, even if it’s not the loudest aspect of the sound (compared to, say, the water splashing). This second model created imitations that were better than the baseline, but the team wanted to improve it even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To take their method a step further, the researchers added a final layer of reasoning to the model. “Vocal imitations can sound different based on the amount of effort you put into them. It costs time and energy to produce sounds that are perfectly accurate,” says Chandra. The researchers’ full model accounts for this by trying to avoid utterances that are very rapid, loud, or high- or low-pitched, which people are less likely to use in a conversation. The result: more human-like imitations that closely match many of the decisions that humans make when imitating the same sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After building this model, the team conducted a behavioral experiment to see whether the AI- or human-generated vocal imitations were perceived as better by human judges. Notably, participants in the experiment favored the AI model 25 percent of the time in general, and as much as 75 percent for an imitation of a motorboat and 50 percent for an imitation of a gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward more expressive sound technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passionate about technology for music and art, Caren envisions that this model could help artists better communicate sounds to computational systems and assist filmmakers and other content creators with generating AI sounds that are more nuanced to a specific context. It could also enable a musician to rapidly search a sound database by imitating a noise that is difficult to describe in, say, a text prompt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Caren, Chandra, and Ma are looking at the implications of their model in other domains, including the development of language, how infants learn to talk, and even imitation behaviors in birds like parrots and songbirds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team still has work to do with the current iteration of their model: It struggles with some consonants, like “z,” which led to inaccurate impressions of some sounds, like bees buzzing. They also can’t yet replicate how humans imitate speech, music, or sounds that are imitated differently across different languages, like a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University linguistics professor Robert Hawkins says that language is full of onomatopoeia and words that mimic but don’t fully replicate the things they describe, like the “meow” sound that very inexactly approximates the sound that cats make. “The processes that get us from the sound of a real cat to a word like ‘meow’ reveal a lot about the intricate interplay between physiology, social reasoning, and communication in the evolution of language,” says Hawkins, who wasn’t involved in the CSAIL research. “This model presents an exciting step toward formalizing and testing theories of those processes, demonstrating that both physical constraints from the human vocal tract and social pressures from communication are needed to explain the distribution of vocal imitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caren, Chandra, and Ma wrote the paper with two other CSAIL affiliates: Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science associate professor, and Joshua Tenenbaum, MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences professor and Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines member. Their work was supported, in part, by the Hertz Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It was presented at SIGGRAPH Asia in early December.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Holden Mui appreciates the details in mathematics and music. A well-written orchestral piece and a well-designed competitive math problem both require a certain flair and a well-tuned sense of how to keep an audience’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“People want fresh, new, non-recycled approaches to math and music,” he says. Mui sees his role as a guide of sorts, someone who can take his ideas for a musical composition or a math problem and share them with audiences in an engaging way. His ideas must make the transition from his mind to the page in as precise a way as possible. Details matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A double major in math and music from Lisle, Illinois, Mui believes it’s important to invite people into a creative process that allows a kind of conversation to occur between a piece of music he writes and his audience, for example. Or a math problem and the people who try to solve it. “Part of math’s appeal is its ability to reveal deep truths that may be hidden in simple statements,” he argues, “while contemporary classical music should be available for enjoyment by as many people as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui’s first experience at MIT was as a high school student in 2017. He visited as a member of a high school math competition team attending an event hosted and staged by MIT and Harvard University students. The following year, Mui met other students at math camps and began thinking seriously about what was next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I chose math as a major because it’s been a passion of mine since high school. My interest grew through competitions and I continued to develop it through research,” he says. “I chose MIT because it boasts one of&amp;nbsp;the most rigorous and accomplished mathematics departments in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui is also a math problem writer for the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament (HMMT) and performs with Ribotones, a club that travels to places like retirement homes or public spaces on the Institute’s campus to play music for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui studies piano with Timothy McFarland, an artist affiliate at MIT, through the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study" title="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study" data-outlook-id="e79ca899-7b74-4503-b2a9-8eebed89f18c"&gt;MIT Emerson/Harris Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt;, and previously studied with Kate Nir and Matthew Hagle of the Music Institute of Chicago. He started piano at the age of five and cites French composer Maurice Ravel as one of his major musical influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a music student at MIT, Mui is involved in piano performance, chamber music, collaborative piano, the MIT Symphony Orchestra as a violist, conducting, and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He enjoys the incredible variety available within MIT’s music program. “It offers everything from electronic music to world music studies,” he notes, “and has broadened my understanding and appreciation of music’s diversity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating to create&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Throughout his academic career, Mui found himself among like-minded students like former Yale University undergraduate Andrew Wu. Together, Mui and Wu won an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures"&gt;Emergent Ventures&lt;/a&gt; grant. In this collaboration, Mui wrote the music Wu would play. Wu described his experience with one of Mui’s compositions,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkAlRaZO_Zs"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt;,” as “demanding serious focus and continued re-readings,” yielding nuances even after repeated listens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another of Mui’s compositions,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM1US3yQ58g"&gt;Landscapes&lt;/a&gt;,” was performed by MIT’s Symphony Orchestra in October 2024 and offered audiences opportunities to engage with the ideas he explores in his music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One of the challenges Mui discovered early is that academic composers sometimes create music audiences might struggle to understand. “People often say that music is a universal language, but one of the most valuable insights I’ve gained at MIT is that music isn’t as universally experienced as one might think,” he says. “There are notable differences, for example, between Western music and world music.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This, Mui says, broadened his perspective on how to approach music and encouraged him to consider his audience more closely when composing. He treats music as an opportunity to invite people into how he thinks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative ideas, accessible outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui understands the value of sharing his skills and ideas with others, crediting the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program with offering multiple opportunities for travel and teaching. “I’ve been on three MISTI trips during IAP [Independent Activities Period] to teach mathematics,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui says it’s important to be flexible, dynamic, and adaptable in preparation for a fulfilling professional life. Music and math both demand the development of the kinds of soft skills that can help him succeed as a musician, composer, and mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Creating math problems is surprisingly similar to writing music,” he argues. “In both cases, the work needs to be complex enough to be interesting without becoming unapproachable.” For Mui, designing original math problems is “like trying to write down an original melody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“To write math problems, you have to have seen a lot of math problems before. To write music, you have to know the literature — Bach, Beethoven, Ravel, Ligeti — as diverse a group of personalities as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A future in the notes and numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mui points to the professional and personal virtues of exploring different fields. “It allows me to build a more diverse network of people with unique perspectives,” he says. “Professionally, having a range of experiences and viewpoints to draw on is invaluable; the broader my knowledge and network, the more insights I can gain to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After graduating, Mui plans to pursue doctoral study in mathematics following the completion of a cryptography internship. “The connections I’ve made at MIT, and will continue to make, are valuable because they’ll be useful regardless of the career I choose,” he says. He wants to continue researching math he finds challenging and rewarding. As with his music, he wants to strike a balance between&amp;nbsp;emotion and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I think it’s important not to pull all of one’s eggs in one basket,” he says. “One important figure that comes to mind is Isaac Newton, who split his time among three fields: physics, alchemy, and theology.” Mui’s path forward will inevitably include music and math. Whether crafting compositions or designing math problems, Mui seeks to invite others into a world where notes and numbers converge to create meaning, inspire connection, and transform understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Seen and heard: The new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building</title>

        <dc:creator>Ken Shulman | Office of the Vice President for Campus Services and Stewardship</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Until very recently, Mariano Salcedo, a fourth-year MIT electronic engineering and computer science student majoring in artificial intelligence and decision-making, was planning to apply for a master’s program in computer science at MIT. Then he saw the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, which opened this fall for a selection of classes. “Now, instead of going into computer science, I’m thinking of applying for the master’s program in Music Technology, which is being offered here for the first time next year,” says Salcedo. “The decision is definitely linked to the building, and what the building says about music at MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Scheduled to open fully in February 2025, the Linde Music Building already makes a bold and elegant visual statement. But its most powerful impact will likely be heard as much as seen. Each of the facility’s elements, including the Thomas Tull Concert Hall, every performance and rehearsal space, each classroom, even the stainless-steel metal panels that form the conic canopies over the cube-like building’s three entrances — has been conceived and constructed to create an ideal environment for music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are already enjoying the ideal acoustics and customized spaces of the Linde Music Building, even as construction on the site continues. Within the building’s thick red-brick walls, they study subjects ranging from Electronic Music Composition to Conducting and Score Reading to Advanced Music Performance. Myriad musical groups, from the MIT jazz combos to the Balinese Gamelan and the Rambax Senegalese Drum Ensemble, explore and enjoy their new and improved homes, as do those students who will create and perfect the next generation of music production hardware and software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For many of us at MIT, music is very close to our hearts,” notes MIT President Sally Kornbluth. “And the new building now puts music right at the heart of the campus. Its exceptional practice and recording spaces will give MIT musicians the conservatory-level tools they deserve, and the beautiful performance hall will exert its own gravitational pull, drawing audiences from across campus and the larger community who love live music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The need and the solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music has never been a minor pursuit at MIT. More than 1,500 MIT students enroll in music classes each academic year. And more than 500 student musicians participate in one of 30 on-campus ensembles. Yet until recently there was no centralized facility for music instruction or rehearsal. Practice rooms were scattered and poorly insulated, with sound seeping through the walls. Nor was there a truly suitable space for large performances; while Kresge Auditorium has sufficient capacity and splendid minimalist aesthetics, the acoustics are not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be very difficult to teach biology or engineering in a studio designed for dance or music,” says Jay Scheib, recently appointed section head for Music and Theater Arts and Class of 1949 Professor. “The same goes for teaching music in a mathematics or chemistry classroom. In the past, we’ve done it, but it did limit us. In our theater program, everything changed when we opened the new theater building (W97) in 2017 and could teach theater in spaces intended for theater. We believe the new music building will have a similar effect on our music program. It will inspire our students and musicians and allow them to hear their music as it was intended to be heard. And it will provide an opportunity to convene people, to inhabit the same space, breathe the same air, and exchange ideas and perspectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music-making from multiple musical traditions are areas of tremendous growth at MIT, both in terms of performance and academics,” says Keeril Makan, associate dean for strategic initiatives for the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS). The Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor and former head of the Music and Theater Arts Section, Makan was, and remains, intimately involved in the Linde Music Building project. “In this building, we wanted all forms of music to coexist, whether jazz, classical, or music from around the world. This was not easy; different types of music require different conditions. But we took the time and invested in making spaces that would support all musical genres.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of creating an epicenter for music at MIT is not new. For several decades, MIT planners and administrators studied various plans and sites on campus, including Kendall Square and areas in West Campus. Then, in 2018, one year after the completion of the Theater Arts Building on Vassar Street, and with support from then-president L. Rafael Reif, the Institute received a cornerstone gift for the music building from arts patron Joyce Linde. Along with her late husband and former MIT Corporation member Edward H. Linde ’62, the late Joyce Linde was a longtime MIT supporter. SANAA, a Tokyo-based architectural firm, was selected for the job in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT chose SANAA in part because their architecture is so beautiful,” says Vasso Mathes, the senior campus planner in the MIT Office of Campus Planning who helped select the SANAA team. “But also because they understood that this building is about acoustics. And they brought the world’s most renowned acoustics consultant, Nagata Acoustics International founder Yasuhisa Toyota, to the project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where form meets function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built on the site of a former parking lot, the Linde Music Building is both stunning and subtle. Designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA, which won the 2010 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the three-volume red brick structure centers both the natural and built environments of MIT’s West Campus — harmonizing effortlessly with Eero Saarinen’s Kresge Auditorium and iconic MIT Chapel, both adjacent, while blending seamlessly with surrounding athletic fields and existing landscaping. With a total of 35,000 square feet of usable space, the building’s three distinct volumes dialogue beautifully with their surroundings. The curved roof reprises elements of Kresge Auditorium, while the exterior evokes Boston and Cambridge’s archetypal facades. The glass-walled lobby, where the three cubic volumes converge, is surprisingly intimate, with ample natural light and inviting views onto three distinct segments of campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing I love about this project is that each program has its own identity in form,” says co-founder and principal Ryue Nishizawa of SANAA. “And there are also in-between spaces that can breathe and blend inside and outside spaces, creating a landscape while preserving the singularity of each program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are myriad signature features — particularly the acoustic features designed by Nagata Acoustics. The Beatrice and Stephen Erdely Music and Culture Space offers the building’s most robust acoustic insulation. Conceived as a home for MIT’s Rambax Senegalese Drum Ensemble and Balinese Gamelan — as well as other music ensembles — the high-ceilinged box-in-box rehearsal space features alternating curved wall panels. The first set reflects sound, the second set absorbs it. The two panel styles are virtually identical to the eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a maximum seating capacity of 390, the Thomas Tull Concert Hall features a suite of gently rising rows that circle a central performance area. The hall can be configured for almost any style and size of performance, from a soloist in the round to a full jazz ensemble. A retractable curtain, an overhanging ring of glass panels, and the same alternating series of curved wall panels offers adaptable and exquisite sound conditions for performers and audience. A season of events are planned for the spring, starting on Feb. 15, 2025, with a celebratory public program and concert. Classrooms, rehearsal spaces, and technical spaces in the Jae S. and Kyuho Lim Music Maker Pavilion — where students will develop state-of-the-art production tools, software, and musical instruments — are similarly outfitted to create a nearly ideal sound environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While acoustic concerns drove the design process for the Linde Music Building, they did not dampen it. Architects, builders, and vendors repeatedly found ingenious and understated ways to infuse beauty into spaces conceived primarily around sound. “There are many technical specifications we had to consider and acoustic conditions we had to create,” says co-founder and principal Kazuyo Sejima of SANAA. “But we didn’t want this to be a purely technical building; rather, a building where people can enjoy creating and listening to music, enjoy coming together, in a space that was functional, but also elegant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realized with sustainable methods and materials, the building features radiant-heat flooring, LED lighting, high-performance thermally broken windows, and a green roof on each volume. A new landscape and underground filters mitigate flood risk and treat rain and stormwater. A two-level 142-space parking garage occupies the space beneath the building. The outdoor scene is completed by Madrigal, a site-specific sculpture by Sanford Biggers. Commissioned by MIT, and administered by the List Visual Arts Center, the Percent-for-Art program selected Sanford Biggers through a committee formed for this project. The 18-foot metal, resin, and mixed-media piece references the African American quilting tradition, weaving, as in a choral composition, diverse patterns and voices into a colorful counterpoint. “Madrigal stands as a vibrant testament to the power of music, tradition, and the enduring spirit of collaboration across time,” says List Visual Arts Center director Paul Ha. “It connects our past and future while enriching our campus and inspiring all who encounter it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New harmonies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a limited opening for classes this fall, the Linde Music Building is already humming with creative activity. There are hands-on workshops for the many sections of class 21M.030 (Introduction to Musics of the World) — one of SHASS’s most popular CI-H classes. Students of music technology hone their skills in digital instrument design and electronic music composition. MIT Balinese Gamelan and the drummers of Rambax enjoy the sublime acoustics of the Music and Culture Space, where they can hear and refine their work in exquisite detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is exciting for me, and all the other students who love music, to be able to take classes in this space completely devoted to music and music technology,” says fourth-year student Mariano Salcedo. “To work in spaces that are made specifically for music and musicians ... for us, it’s a nice way of being seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linde Music Building will certainly help MIT musicians feel seen and heard. But it will also enrich the MIT experience for students in all schools and departments. “Music courses at MIT have been popular with students across disciplines. I’m incredibly thrilled that students will have brand-new, brilliantly designed spaces for performance, instruction, and prototyping,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, MIT’s chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of the School of Engineering, and Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “The building will also offer tremendous opportunities for students to gather, build community, and innovate across disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This building and its three programs encapsulate the breadth of interest among our students,” says Melissa Nobles, MIT chancellor and Class of 1922 Professor of Political Science. Nobles was a steadfast advocate for the music building project. “It will strengthen our already-robust music community and will draw new people in.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linde Music Building has inspired other members of the MIT community. “Now faculty can use these truly wonderful spaces for their research,” says Makan. “The offices here are also studios, and have acoustic treatments and sound isolation. Musicians and music technologists can work in those spaces.” Makan is composing a piece for solo violin to be premiered in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall early next year. During the performance, student violinists will deploy strategically in various points about the hall to accompany the piece, taking full advantage of the space’s singular acoustics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agustín Rayo, the Kenan Sahin Dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, expects the Linde Music Building to inspire people beyond the MIT community as well. “Of course this building brings incredible resources to MIT’s music program: top-quality rehearsal spaces, a professional-grade recording studio, and new labs for our music technology program,” he says “But the world-class concert hall will also create new opportunities to connect with people in the Boston area. This is truly a jewel of the MIT campus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February open house and concert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Music and Theater Arts Section plans to host an open house in the new building on Feb. 15, 2025. Members of the MIT community and the general public will be invited to an afternoon of activities and performances. The celebration of music will continue with a series of concerts open to the public throughout the spring. Details will be available at &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/"&gt;the Music and Theater Arts website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73b69c58-7fff-15b7-2349-db61db4722ab"&gt;A crowd gathered at the MIT Media Lab in September for a concert by musician Jordan Rudess and two collaborators. One of them, violinist and vocalist Camilla Bäckman, has performed with Rudess before. The other — an artificial intelligence model informally dubbed the jam_bot, which Rudess developed with an MIT team over the preceding several months — was making its public debut as a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Throughout the show, Rudess and Bäckman exchanged the signals and smiles of experienced musicians finding a groove together. Rudess’ interactions with the jam_bot suggested a different and unfamiliar kind of exchange. During one duet inspired by Bach, Rudess alternated between playing a few measures and allowing the AI to continue the music in a similar baroque style. Each time the model took its turn, a range of expressions moved across Rudess’ face: bemusement, concentration, curiosity. At the end of the piece, Rudess admitted to the audience, “That is a combination of a whole lot of fun and really, really challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rudess is an acclaimed keyboardist —&amp;nbsp;the best of all time, according to one&amp;nbsp;Music Radar magazine poll — known for his work with the platinum-selling, Grammy-winning progressive metal band Dream Theater, which embarks this fall on a 40th anniversary tour. He is also a solo artist whose latest album, “&lt;a href="https://www.jordanrudess.com/announcing-my-new-solo-album-permission-to-fly-and-new-single-the-alchemist/"&gt;Permission to Fly&lt;/a&gt;,” was released on Sept. 6; an educator who shares his skills through detailed online tutorials; and the founder of software company Wizdom Music. His work combines a rigorous classical foundation (he began his piano studies at The Juilliard School at age 9) with a genius for improvisation and an appetite for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Last spring, Rudess became a visiting artist with the MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology (CAST), collaborating with the MIT Media Lab’s Responsive Environments research group on the creation of new AI-powered music technology. Rudess’ main collaborators in the enterprise are Media Lab graduate students Lancelot Blanchard, who researches musical applications of generative AI (informed by his own studies in classical piano), and Perry Naseck, an artist and engineer specializing in interactive, kinetic, light- and time-based media. Overseeing the project is Professor Joseph Paradiso, head of the Responsive Environments group and a longtime Rudess fan. Paradiso arrived at the Media Lab in 1994 with a CV in physics and engineering and a sideline designing and building synthesizers to explore his avant-garde musical tastes. His group has a tradition of investigating musical frontiers through novel user interfaces, sensor networks, and unconventional datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers set out to develop a machine learning model channeling Rudess’ distinctive musical style and technique. In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/iz684jjr/release/1"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published online by MIT Press in September, co-authored with MIT music technology professor Eran Egozy, they articulate their vision for what they call “symbiotic virtuosity:” for human and computer to duet in real-time, learning from each duet they perform together, and making performance-worthy new music in front of a live audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rudess contributed the data on which Blanchard trained the AI model. Rudess also provided continuous testing and feedback, while Naseck experimented with ways of visualizing the technology for the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Audiences are used to seeing lighting, graphics, and scenic elements at many concerts, so we needed a platform to allow the AI to build its own relationship with the audience,” Naseck says. In early demos, this took the form of a sculptural installation with illumination that shifted each time the AI changed chords. During the concert on Sept. 21, a grid of petal-shaped panels mounted behind Rudess came to life through choreography based on the activity and future generation of the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If you see jazz musicians make eye contact and nod at each other, that gives anticipation to the audience of what’s going to happen,” says Naseck. “The AI is effectively generating sheet music and then playing it. How do we show what’s coming next and communicate that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Naseck designed and programmed the structure from scratch at the Media Lab with assistance from Brian Mayton (mechanical design) and Carlo Mandolini (fabrication), drawing some of its movements from an experimental machine learning model developed by visiting student Madhav Lavakare that maps music to points moving in space. With the ability to spin and tilt its petals at speeds ranging from subtle to dramatic, the kinetic sculpture distinguished the AI’s contributions during the concert from those of the human performers, while conveying the emotion and energy of its output: swaying gently when Rudess took the lead, for example, or furling and unfurling like a blossom as the AI model generated stately chords for an improvised adagio. The latter was one of Naseck’s favorite moments of the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At the end, Jordan and Camilla left the stage and allowed the AI to fully explore its own direction,” he recalls. “The sculpture made this moment very powerful — it allowed the stage to remain animated and intensified the grandiose nature of the chords the AI played. The audience was clearly captivated by this part, sitting at the edges of their seats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The goal is to create a musical visual experience,” says Rudess,&amp;nbsp;“to show what’s possible and to up the game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musical futures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As the starting point for his model, Blanchard used a music transformer, an open-source neural network architecture developed by MIT Assistant Professor Anna Huang SM ’08, who joined the MIT faculty in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Music transformers work in a similar way as large language models,” Blanchard explains. “The same way that ChatGPT would generate the most probable next word, the model we have would predict the most probable next notes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Blanchard fine-tuned the model using Rudess’ own playing of elements from bass lines to chords to melodies, variations of which Rudess recorded in his New York studio. Along the way, Blanchard ensured the AI would be nimble enough to respond in real-time to Rudess’ improvisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We reframed the project,” says Blanchard, “in terms of musical futures that were hypothesized by the model and that were only being realized at the moment based on what Jordan was deciding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As Rudess puts it: “How can the AI respond —&amp;nbsp;how can I have a dialogue with it? That’s the cutting-edge part of what we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Another priority emerged: “In the field of generative AI and music, you hear about startups like Suno or Udio that are able to generate music based on text prompts. Those are very interesting, but they lack controllability,” says Blanchard. “It was important for Jordan to be able to anticipate what was going to happen. If he could see the AI was going to make a decision he didn’t want, he could restart the generation or have a kill switch so that he can take control again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to giving Rudess a screen previewing the musical decisions of the model, Blanchard built in different modalities the musician could activate as he plays — prompting the AI to generate chords or lead melodies, for example, or initiating a call-and-response pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Jordan is the mastermind of everything that’s happening,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would Jordan do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Though the residency has wrapped up, the collaborators see many paths for continuing the research. For example, Naseck would like to experiment with more ways Rudess could interact directly with his installation, through features like capacitive sensing. “We hope in the future we’ll be able to work with more of his subtle motions and posture,” Naseck says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the MIT collaboration focused on how Rudess can use the tool to augment his own performances, it’s easy to imagine other applications. Paradiso recalls an early encounter with the tech: “I played a chord sequence, and Jordan’s model was generating the leads. It was like having a musical ‘bee’ of Jordan Rudess buzzing around the melodic foundation I was laying down, doing something like Jordan would do, but subject to the simple progression I was playing,” he recalls, his face echoing the delight he felt at the time. “You're going to see AI plugins for your favorite musician that you can bring into your own compositions, with some knobs that let you control the particulars,” he posits. “It’s that kind of world we’re opening up with this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rudess is also keen to explore educational uses. Because the samples he recorded to train the model were similar to ear-training exercises he’s used with students, he thinks the model itself could someday be used for teaching. “This work has legs beyond just entertainment value,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The foray into artificial intelligence is a natural progression for Rudess’ interest in music technology. “This&amp;nbsp;is the next step,” he believes. When he discusses the work with fellow musicians, however, his enthusiasm for AI often meets with resistance. “I can have sympathy or compassion for a musician who feels threatened, I totally get that,” he allows. “But my mission is to be one of the people who moves this technology toward positive things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At the Media Lab, it’s so important to think about how AI and humans come together for the benefit of all,” says Paradiso. “How is AI going to lift us all up? Ideally it will do what so many technologies have done — bring us into another vista where we’re more enabled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Jordan is ahead of the pack,” Paradiso adds. “Once it’s established with him, people will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamming with MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Media Lab first landed on Rudess’ radar before his residency because he wanted to try out the Knitted Keyboard created by another member of Responsive Environments, textile researcher Irmandy Wickasono PhD ’24. From that moment on, “It's been a discovery for me, learning about the cool things that are going on at MIT in the music world,” Rudess says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During two visits to Cambridge last spring (assisted by his wife, theater and music producer Danielle Rudess), Rudess reviewed final projects in Paradiso’s course on electronic music controllers, the syllabus for which included videos of his own past performances. He brought a new gesture-driven synthesizer called Osmose to a class on interactive music systems taught by Egozy, whose credits include the co-creation of the video game “Guitar Hero.” Rudess also provided tips on improvisation to a composition class; played GeoShred, a touchscreen musical instrument he co-created with Stanford University researchers, with student musicians in the MIT Laptop Ensemble and Arts Scholars program; and experienced immersive audio in the MIT Spatial Sound Lab. During his most recent trip to campus in September, he taught a masterclass for pianists in MIT’s Emerson/Harris Program, which provides a total of 67 scholars and fellows with support for conservatory-level musical instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I get a kind of rush whenever I come to the university,” Rudess says. “I feel the sense that, wow, all of my musical ideas and inspiration and interests have come together in this really cool way.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has announced the launch of a new program to support postdocs conducting research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and particular disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/tayebati-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/"&gt;Tayebati Postdoctoral Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt; will focus on AI for addressing the most challenging problems in select scientific research areas, and on AI for music composition and performance. The program will welcome an inaugural cohort of up to six postdocs for a one-year term, with the possibility of renewal for a second term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by a $20 million gift from Parviz Tayebati, an entrepreneur and executive with a broad technical background and experience with startup companies, the program will empower top postdocs by providing an environment that facilitates their academic and professional development and enables them to pursue ambitious discoveries. “I am proud to support a fellowship program that champions interdisciplinary research and fosters collaboration across departments. My hope is that this gift will inspire a new generation of scholars whose research advances knowledge and nurtures innovation that transcends traditional boundaries,” says Tayebati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Artificial intelligence holds tremendous potential to accelerate breakthroughs in science and ignite human creativity," says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the Schwarzman College of Computing and Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “This new postdoc program is a remarkable opportunity to cultivate exceptional bilingual talent combining AI and another discipline. The program will offer fellows the chance to engage in research at the forefront of both AI and another field, collaborating with leading experts across disciplines. We are deeply thankful to Parviz for his foresight in supporting the development of researchers in this increasingly important area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates accepted into the program will work on projects that encompass one of six disciplinary areas: biology/bioengineering, brain and cognitive sciences, chemistry/chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, music, and physics. Each fellow will have a faculty mentor in the disciplinary area as well as in AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tayebati Postdoctoral Fellowship Program is a key component of a larger focus of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing aimed at fostering innovative research in computing. As part of this focus, the college has three postdoctoral programs, each of which provides training and mentorship to fellows, broadens their research horizons, and helps them develop expertise in computing, including its intersection with other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other programs include &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/research/postdoctoral-fellows-programs/meteor-program/" target="_blank"&gt;MEnTorEd Opportunities in Research&lt;/a&gt; (METEOR), which was established by the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2020. Recently expanded to span MIT through the college, the goal of METEOR is to support exceptional scholars in computer science and AI and to broaden participation in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC), a cross-cutting initiative of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, offers researchers exploring how computing is reshaping society the opportunity to participate as a &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-postdocs/" target="_blank"&gt;SERC postdoc&lt;/a&gt;. SERC postdocs engage in a number of activities throughout the year, including leading interdisciplinary teams of MIT undergraduate and graduate students, known as SERC Scholars, to work on research projects investigating such topics as generative AI and democracy, combating deepfakes, examining data ownership, and the societal impact of gamification, among others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new, multidisciplinary MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://musictech.mit.edu/mtcgp"&gt;graduate program in music technology and computation&lt;/a&gt; will feature faculty, labs, and curricula from across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program is a collaboration between the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Music and Theater Arts Section&lt;/a&gt; in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) and the &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Faculty for the program share appointments between the Music and Theater Arts Section, the &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; (EECS), and the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The launch of a new graduate program in music technology strikes me as both a necessary and a&amp;nbsp;provocative gesture — an important leap in an era being rapidly redefined by exponential growth in computation, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interactions of every conceivable kind,”&amp;nbsp;says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/jay-scheib" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Scheib&lt;/a&gt;,​​ head of the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the Class of 1949 Professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Music plays an elegant role at the fore of a remarkable convergence of art and technology,” adds Scheib. “It’s the right time to launch this program and if not at MIT, then where?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s practitioners define music technology as the field of scientific inquiry where they study, discover, and develop new computational approaches to music that include music information retrieval; artificial intelligence; machine learning; generative algorithms; interaction and performance systems; digital instrument design; conceptual and perceptual modeling of music; acoustics; audio signal processing; and software development for creative expression and music applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/eran-egozy" target="_blank"&gt;Eran Egozy&lt;/a&gt;, professor of the practice in music technology and one of the program leads, says MIT’s focus is technical research in music technology that always centers the humanistic and artistic aspects of making music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many MIT students who are fabulous musicians,” says Egozy. “We'll approach music technology as computer scientists, mathematicians, and musicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the launch of this new program — an offering alongside those available in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=everything&amp;amp;tag=music"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere — Egozy sees MIT becoming the obvious destination for students interested in music and computation study, preparing high-impact graduates for roles in academia and industry, while also helping mold creative, big-picture thinkers who can tackle large challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating big ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program will encompass two master’s degrees and a PhD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Science (MS) is a two-semester, thesis-based program available only to MIT undergraduates. One semester of fellowship is automatically awarded to all admitted students. The first class will enroll in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Applied Science (MAS) is a two-semester, coursework-based program available to all students. One semester of fellowship funding is automatically awarded to all admitted students. Applications for this program will open in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The PhD program is available to all students, who would apply to MIT’s School of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/anna-huang" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a new MIT assistant professor who holds a shared faculty position between the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, is collaborating with Egozy to develop and launch the program. Huang arrived at MIT this fall after spending eight years with Magenta at Google Brain and DeepMind, spearheading efforts in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction to support human-AI partnerships in music-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As a composer turned AI researcher who specializes in generative music technology, my long-term goal is to develop AI systems that can shed new light on how we understand, learn, and create music, and to learn from interactions between musicians in order to transform how we approach human-AI collaboration,” says Huang. “This new program will let us further investigate how musical applications can illuminate problems in understanding neural networks, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s new &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-keeril-makan-new-mit-music-building-0109"&gt;Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building&lt;/a&gt;, featuring&amp;nbsp;enhanced music technology spaces, will also help transform music education with versatile performance venues and optimized rehearsal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural home for music technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s world-class, top-ranked engineering program, combined with its focus on computation and its conservatory-level music education offerings, makes the Institute a natural home for the continued expansion of music technology education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The collaborative nature of the new program is the latest example of interdisciplinary work happening across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I am thrilled that the School of Engineering is partnering with the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section on this important initiative, which represents the convergence of various engineering areas — such as AI and design — with music,” says &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/about/leadership/anantha-p-chandrakasan/" target="_blank"&gt;Anantha Chandrakasan&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the School of Engineering, chief innovation and strategy officer, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of EECS. “I can’t wait to see the innovative projects the students will create and how they will drive this new field forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Everyone on campus knows that MIT is a great place to do music. But I want people to come to MIT because of what we do in music,” says &lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/rayo/" target="_blank"&gt;Agustin Rayo&lt;/a&gt;, the Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS. “This outstanding collaboration with the Schwarzman College of Computing and the School of Engineering will make that dream a reality, by bringing together the world’s best engineers with our extraordinary musicians to create the next generation of music technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The new master’s program offers students an unparalleled opportunity to explore the intersection of music and technology,” says &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/daniel-huttenlocher/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Huttenlocher&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of EECS. “It equips them with a deep understanding of this confluence, preparing them to advance new approaches to computational models of music and be at the forefront of an evolving area.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>One of MIT’s best-kept secrets lives in the Institute’s basement</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/wmbr-radio-station-0503</link>
  <description><![CDATA[With roots dating to 1946, radio station WMBR airs daily on 88.1 FM.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When MIT's Walker Memorial (Building 50) was constructed in 1916, it was among the first buildings located on the Institute’s then-new Cambridge campus. At the time, national headlines would have heralded Gideon Sundback’s invention of the modern zipper, the first transcontinental phone call by Alexander Graham Bell, and Charles Fahbry’s discovery of the ozone layer. It would be another 12 years before the invention of sliced bread, and, importantly, four years before the first U.S.-licensed commercial radio station would go on the air.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In true MIT fashion, the past, present, and future of Building 50 seem to coexist within its hallways. Today, the basement of Walker Memorial is home to what some students consider to be one of the Institute’s best-kept secrets&amp;nbsp;— something that likely never crossed the minds of its original architects: a 24-hour, high-fidelity radio station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating under the call sign WMBR 88.1 FM (for “Walker Memorial Basement Radio”), this all-volunteer troupe has endured many hurdles similar to those faced by others in the field as radio itself has largely changed over the years. But as general managers James Rock and Maggie Lin will tell you, there’s something special about this station’s ability to build deeper connections within the larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Students have the opportunity to get to know a bunch of our community members,” explains Rock. “Our tech director works closely with every student who wants to contribute, which involves anything from manning a drill to climbing to the roof of Walker and manually bending the antenna back into shape, which I did a couple of weeks ago,” laughs Rock. “Most of our student members are trained by someone who's been around and really knows what they’re doing with radio after decades of experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really fun,” says Lin. “It’s being able to hang out with people who love music just as much as you do. The older members of the station are such a cool resource for talking about different kinds of music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now sophomores, Rock and Lin first arrived at MIT and WMBR two years ago. At the time, the station was mitigating the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which WMBR went off the air temporarily. “We’ve been general managers since last spring, so the majority of our time at the station has been managing the station,” explains Lin. “We just came at a time when the station didn’t have many student members because of Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lin recalls stories from disc jockeys who were at the station the night in 2020 when WMBR went off the air: “I’m told it was extremely sudden. There was someone here who said they finished their show and left a tote bag of records for the next time they were going to come back, and they left … and they still haven’t [returned].”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, resilience is a trait that WMBR has displayed in abundance throughout its storied 80-year history. First signing on as WMIT on Nov. 25, 1946, the station’s original equipment was built from the ground up by MIT electrical engineering students. In 1956, when the station’s call letters were licensed to a radio station in North Carolina, the Cambridge-based station became WTBS. And when the station was in dire need of cash for new equipment in the 1970s, its members found a creative solution: an agreement with media mogul Ted Turner to exchange the call letters WTBS for $50,000. This afforded the station the new equipment it dearly needed and allowed Turner to launch the Turner Broadcasting System. The station subsequently became WMBR on Nov. 10, 1979.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s no surprise how station members responded to the challenges posed by Covid. “The tech team pulled off something kind of crazy when they set that up,” says Lin. “Within weeks, they set up a system where people could upload files of shows they recorded from home, and then it would be broadcast live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sticking to the hybrid system means that especially new members have the flexibility to start out recording from home,” adds Rock. “That’s what Maggie and I did. It means if you're scared, a little jumpy, or stutter as you speak, you can go back and edit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The station also expanded its slate of new content in the years following the pandemic. “I think the most lasting effect of Covid is that we are now 24/7,” says Rock. “Most of the time it’s fresh material now. The spring schedule is guaranteed fresh material from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a packed schedule,” adds Lin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the sheer amount of original programming now airing on WMBR, it would be easy to assume the station relies heavily on ad revenue to keep the lights on. But, thanks to one fundraising week held each November, the station keeps pumping out music and spoken-word shows such as “&lt;a href="https://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/show?id=8213"&gt;Music for Eels&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href="https://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/show?id=8107"&gt;Post-Tentious&lt;/a&gt;,” and “&lt;a href="https://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/show?id=8253"&gt;Crunchy Plastic Dinosaurs&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And operating an FM radio station is not cheap,” says Rock, “maintaining the antennas and buying new tech equipment, getting music, paying licensing fees, and ordering pizza to keep the students on board because the DJs have to be happy, etc. So it’s a real privilege that we are able to operate on that listener funding from that one week each year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of crazy, because when you're broadcasting, it’s to Greater Boston, but you really don’t know how many people are listening,” adds Lin. “And I think it's really awesome when you see fundraising week. It’s like, ‘Yeah, people really do listen.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And if a donor chooses to pledge to a show, generally the DJs will mail a postcard back as thanks for that donation. So, if you want a signature of Maggie’s or mine, support us in November!” laughs Rock. “Limiting [fundraising] to one week means that we never advertise, so as long as we keep that contained to one-52nd of the year, the rest of the time you just get the music and the DJ’s commentary you tuned in for. There’s no solicitation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this highlights the paradox of WMBR: reconciling its undeniable audience of loyal listeners and passionate community members with the fact that many MIT students and employees have never heard of WMBR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of people just don’t quite know that the radio station is something that exists,” explains Lin. “I understand it’s because people our age don't really listen to radio much anymore, but I think the space is so amazing. A lot of the new students that we bring in are pretty awed by it, especially the record library; with hundreds of thousands of records and CDs, and the studios,” says Lin, referencing the station’s impressive collection of music, which fills a space so large that it once held a bowling alley. “It’s an opportunity that is kind of easy to miss out on. So I feel like we’re bringing in new members&amp;nbsp;— which I’m really happy about&amp;nbsp;— but I just want people to know that WMBR is here, and it’s really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes. I second that,” says Rock. “MIT is so full of opportunities and resources that you can’t possibly take advantage of all of them, but we are hidden here in the basement of Walker Memorial where students don’t really make it [to] that often.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Listeners don’t even know,” laughs Lin. “We had someone pass by the door once, and they were like, ‘The radio station? It’s here?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know there was a campus radio station, and I frankly hadn’t really thought of campus radio until I walked into Activities Midway during my first CPW [Campus Preview Weekend], and maybe orientation,” adds Rock. “One of the great things about it is that you can share your own music tastes with all of greater Boston. You have the aux cord for an hour every week, and it’s such a privilege.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of scary-sounding to think, ‘You're going to go sit behind a microphone and all of Greater Boston will hear you,’” adds Lin. “But James is always full of confidence, so I just thought, ‘What if we did a show together?’ That’s another thing that we like as we get new students in: people who want to co-host shows together.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are always looking for new student members,” says Rock. “Whether you want to do a radio show, podcast, help with maintaining and upgrading our broadcast equipment, or gain valuable experience helping to manage and lead a nonprofit organization that is an eclectic mix of MIT students, staff, and members of the local community, let us know!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker Memorial Basement Radio (WMBR) is currently on the air and streaming 24/7. Listen online &lt;a href="https://wmbr.org/www/listen"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or tune your dial to 88.1 FM. To find out more about joining WMBR, send a message to &lt;a href="mailto:membership@wmbr.org"&gt;membership@wmbr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;World-renowned cellist Carlos Prieto&amp;nbsp;’59 returned to campus for an event to perform and to discuss his new memoir, “Mi Vida Musical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the April 9 event in the Samberg Conference Center, Prieto spoke about his formative years at MIT and his subsequent career as a professional cellist. The talk was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noO9329Er9I" target="_blank"&gt;followed by performances&lt;/a&gt; of J.S. Bach’s “Cello Suite No. 3” and Eugenio “Toussaint’s Bachriation.” Valerie Chen, a 2022 Sudler Prize winner and Emerson/Harris Fellow, also performed Phillip Glass’s “Orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prieto was born in Mexico City and began studying the cello when he was 4. He graduated from MIT with BS degrees in 1959 in Course 3, then called the Metallurgical Engineering and today Materials Science and Engineering, and in Course 14 (Economics). He was the first cello and soloist of the MIT Symphony Orchestra. While at MIT, he took all available courses in Russian, which allowed him, years later, to study at Lomonosov University in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation from MIT, Prieto returned to Mexico, where he rose to become the head of an integrated iron and steel company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I returned to Mexico, I was very active in my business life, but I was also very active in my music life,” he told the audience. “And at one moment, the music overcame all the other activities and I left my business activities to devote all my time to the cello and I’ve been doing this for the past 50 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his musical career, Prieto played all over the world and has played and recorded the world premieres of 115 compositions, most of which were written for him. He is the author of 14 books, some of which have been translated into English, Russian, and Portuguese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prieto’s honors include the Order of the Arts and Letters from France, the Order of Civil Merit from the&amp;nbsp;King of Spain, and the National Prize for Arts and Sciences from the president of Mexico. In 1993 he was appointed member of the MIT Music and Theater Advisory Committee. In 2014, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences awarded&amp;nbsp;Prieto&amp;nbsp;the Robert A. Muh Alumni Award.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Drinking from a firehose — on stage</title>

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What happens when a bunch of students used to drinking from a firehose decide to channel their energy into musical theater? If what you’re picturing is a bit chaotic, you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, the MIT Music Theater Guild (MTG) has put on epic performances that are equal parts ambitious, impressive, and creative. From “Rocky Horror Picture Show” to original remakes of superhero blockbusters and everything in between, the productions are, above all else, entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At its core, it’s just students being passionate about the art they are creating and giving back to their community,” says senior Michaela Purvis, who has served as a president, choreographer, cast member, and more with MTG. “Something about that is really special for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the group are quick to point out that MTG is completely student-run, which makes for a quirky, scrappy culture in which members step up to serve in whatever roles are needed for each show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may sound like a difficult way to maintain the group’s four annual performances, but since it was formed in 1971, MTG students have consistently committed themselves to complex shows with an enthusiasm that not even a global pandemic could stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we’ve existed continually for so long speaks volumes,” Purvis says. “I think it shows the persistence and spirit of students in general. When we’re in pursuit of a project, we’re able to carry it through.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, current and former members say MTG’s spirit is an extension of MIT’s ethos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT students have this attitude that anything that is technically possible can be done,” says Matt Putnam ’09, who has stayed involved with MTG since graduating. “It’s similar to the hacks. … Musical theater is similarly bonkers. If musical theater didn’t exist, and I said, ‘We’re going to put on a show that’s like a movie, but it’s going to be live and everyone’s going to have to memorize two hours-worth of lines, and we’re going to add songs and dances people will need to learn, and we’re going to need sets and lights and choreography and props.’ You’d say that’s crazy. But it is technically possible, so I think students dive into it with this attitude of ‘Let’s make it happen.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MTG’s members usually wait until a couple of months before their next performance to pick what show they’ll do, which makes for a hectic preparation but ensures students like what they’re performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some MTG positions, like president and treasurer, are decided on a biannual basis. But many positions are filled after a show is selected. In addition to the actors and musicians, there are carpenters, lighting and sound engineers, costume, hair, and makeup managers, and even a webmaster and documentarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The biggest misconception is you need to be able to sing, act, and dance to be a part of the Music Theater Guild,” junior Eleanor Jaffe says. “You don’t need to be able to do anything. You just need to want to do something. That can be painting, it can be acting, dancing, sewing — literally anything. We have a role for anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week before showtime, everyone comes together to assemble the set. Then the group is in production week. Mondays are spent setting up the technical elements of the stage and conducting a full run-of-show. Tuesday night is orchestra night. There are dress rehearsals Wednesday and Thursday where members try to get through everything without stopping. Friday is showtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Opening night, even in the best of cases, feels sudden and rushed and not quite ready,” Putnam says. “You have to accept it’s never going to be perfect. Some people are quite nervous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be a surprise that things don’t always go according to plan. Fortunately, overcoming adversity is one of MTG’s specialties. One year, a blizzard closed campus during two of MTG’s sold-out shows. Kresge Auditorium was already booked for the make-up dates, so MTG performed in a lecture hall (the set and light teams improvised). Another year, on the first day of “Jesus Christ: Superstar,” the actress playing Mary Magdalene walked in sick and unable to sing. With two hours until showtime, the organizers called another member who hadn’t been involved in the show. That member agreed to sit in the orchestra pit and perform every song into a microphone while the original actress lip-synced. Even during the pandemic, the group published virtual shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a very standard way we do everything, and sometimes things get wobbly and we have to figure them out, but there’s such a large history that we know how to get things done,” Jaffe says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A show that still holds a prominent role in MTG lore is a 2003 performance that lumped the first three “Star Wars” movies into one epic musical parody. That’s the show that hooked Putnam, who remembers one costume designer using a vacuum form machine to create storm trooper armor. Legend holds that the show featured more than 200 costumes. MTG eventually &lt;a href="https://alum.mit.edu/slice/who-remembers-mits-star-wars-trilogy-musical-edition" target="_blank"&gt;performed the show at the opening of a “Star Wars” exhibit&lt;/a&gt; at the Museum of Science in front of George Lucas himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was the most incredible thing I’d ever seen,” Putnam recalls. “It pulled in so many different resources from the community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current and former MTG members say it’s fulfilling to be a part of something that requires people from so many different backgrounds. There’s truly something for everyone in MTG, whether students are looking to apply their engineering and design skills, find an outlet for their side hobbies, or they just like to sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Putting together a show is kind of like being on an engineering team or working for a company with a lot of different departments,” says Putnam who currently works as a software engineer. “That’s what’s so exciting about musical theater for me: how many different people and skillsets come together to make the finished product.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>2024 MacVicar Faculty Fellows named </title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/2024-macvicar-faculty-fellows-0315</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Professors Berggren, Campbell, Pollock, and Vaikuntanathan are honored for exceptional undergraduate teaching. ]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Meghan Burke | Registrar’s Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four outstanding undergraduate teachers and mentors have been named MacVicar Faculty Fellows: professor of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) Karl Berggren, professor of political science Andrea Campbell, associate professor of music Emily Richmond Pollock, and professor of EECS Vinod Vaikuntanathan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the MacVicar Faculty Fellows Program has recognized exemplary and sustained contributions to undergraduate education at MIT. The program is named in honor of &lt;a href="https://registrar.mit.edu/faculty-curriculum-support/faculty-awards/margaret-macvicar-faculty-fellows-program/about-margaret"&gt;Margaret MacVicar&lt;/a&gt;, MIT’s first dean for undergraduate education and founder of the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New fellows are chosen each year through a highly competitive nomination process. They receive an annual stipend and are appointed to a 10-year term. Nominations, including letters of support from colleagues, students, and alumni, are reviewed by an advisory committee led by vice chancellor Ian Waitz with final selections made by provost Cynthia Barnhart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Role models both in and out of the classroom, Berggren, Campbell, Pollock, and Vaikuntanathan join an elite academy of scholars from across the Institute who are committed to curricular innovation; exceptional teaching; collaboration with colleagues; and supporting students through mentorship, leadership, and advising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karl Berggren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a great honor to have been selected for this fellowship. It has particularly made me remember the years of dedicated mentoring and support that I’ve received from my colleagues,” says Karl Berggren. “I’ve also learned a great deal over this period from our students by way of their efforts and thoughtful feedback. MIT continuously strives for excellence in undergraduate education, and I feel very lucky to have been part of that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karl Berggren is the Joseph F. and Nancy P. Keithley Professor in the Department of EECS. He received his PhD from Harvard University and his BA in physics from Harvard College. Berggren joined MIT in 1996 as a staff member at Lincoln Laboratory before becoming an assistant professor in 2003. He regularly teaches undergraduate EECS offerings including 6.2000, formerly 6.002 (Electrical Circuits), and 6.3400, formerly 6.02 (Introduction to EECS via Communication Networks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahil Pontula ’23 writes&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“Professor Berggren turned 6.002 from a mere course requirement into a truly memorable experience that shaped my current research interests and provided a unique perspective … He is devoted not just to educating the next generation of engineers, but also to imbuing in them interdisciplinary problem-solving perspectives that push the frontiers of science forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacVicar Fellow and professor of EECS Jeffrey Lang notes, “His lectures are polished, presented with humor, and well-appreciated by his students.” Senior Tiffany Louie&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;adds: “He connects with us, inspires us, and welcomes us to ask questions in class and in the greater electrical engineering field.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berggren is also deeply invested in the art and science of teaching. Tomás Palacios, professor of EECS, says, “Professor Berggren is genuinely interested in continuously improving the educational experience of our students. He approaches this in the same methodological and quantitative way we typically approach research. He is well-versed in the most modern theories about learning and he is always happy to share … relevant books and papers on the subject.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lang agrees, noting that Berggren “reads articles and books that examine and discuss how learning occurs so that he can become a more eﬀective teacher.” He goes on to recall a conversation in which Berggren explained a new form of homework grading. Instead of reducing grades for errors that did not render an obviously flawed result, he helps students extract key takeaways from their assignments and come to correct solutions on their own. Lang notes that a key benefit of this approach is that it allows graders to “work much more quickly yet carefully” and “provides them more time to spend on giving helpful feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to his long list of contributions, Berggren also oversees the EECS teaching labs. Since assuming this role, he has pursued changes to ensure that students feel comfortable and confident using the space for both coursework and outside projects, developing their critical thinking and hands-on skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty head and professor of electrical engineering Joel Voldman applauds Berggren’s efforts: “Since [he] has taken over, the labs are now a place for projects of all sorts, with students being trained on various processes, parts being easy to obtain, equipment readily available … His fundamental mantra has been to make a space that serves students, meets them where they’re at, and helps them get to where they want to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrea Campbell &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrea Campbell received her BA in social studies from Harvard University and her MA and PhD in political science from the University of California at Berkeley&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She joined MIT’s Department of Political Science in 2005 and is currently the Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of Political Science and director of undergraduate studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Campbell regularly teaches classes 17.30 (Making Public Policy), 17.315 (Health Policy), and 17.317 (U.S. Social Policy). Her research examines the relationships between public policies, public opinion, and political behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique aspect of Campbell’s teaching style is the personal approach she brings. In 17.315, Campbell shared her own experiences following a tragic accident in her family, which highlighted the real-life challenges that many face navigating America’s health care system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to David Singer, department head and the Raphael Dorman-Helen Starbuck Professor of Political Science, Campbell “weaves personal experience into her teaching in powerful ways … Her openness about her experience permits students to share their own … thereby strengthening their own engagement with the material.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singer goes on to say, “In all of her classes, [she] encourages students to examine policymaking not as a technocratic exercise, or an exercise of optimization, but rather as a process infused with politics. In steering her pedagogy in this way, she shows her students how to understand the identity and interests of different groups in society, where their relative power emanates from, and how the rules and institutions of the U.S. political system shape policy outcomes on critical issues like LGBTQ rights, gun control, military intervention, and health care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students say her classes are incredibly impactful, lingering with them for years to come. Her former teaching assistant, now Harvard professor, Justin de Benedictis-Kessner wrote, “Andrea’s talents have been an enormous asset … I have seen how many of her former undergraduate students have gone on to successful careers adjacent to her field of public policy in large part because of her inspiration.” Echoing this sentiment, Julia H. Ginder ’19 writes, “her lessons and mentorship have impacted my day-to-day life and career trajectory even five years after graduation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campbell’s work set the stage for wide-ranging improvements to the Course 17 curriculum and under her leadership, public policy has become the most popular minor in the department. Singer writes, “She ensures that required classes in political institutions, economics, and substantive policy areas are regularly taught, and she proselytizes … to students about the importance of understanding policymaking, especially to [those] in engineering and sciences who might otherwise overlook this critically important domain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campbell is heavily involved with undergraduate advising at the department, school, and Institute levels. She is a popular sponsor of UROPs and attracts many undergraduate researchers each year. Campbell is also co-chair of the Gender Equity Committee in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) and the Subcommittee on the Communication Requirement (SOCR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is clear that Andrea takes undergraduate teaching extraordinarily seriously, not just when designing her own classes, but when leading the undergraduate program in our department,” says Adam Berinsky, the Mitsui Professor of Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond her many pedagogical and curricular accomplishments, Singer notes: “Andrea’s students consistently tout her extraordinary degree of personal engagement. She takes the time to get to know students, to mentor them outside the classroom, and to keep them energized in the classroom. Many express gratitude for Andrea’s willingness to go the extra mile — by staying late after class, holding extra office hours, and even inviting students to her home for Thanksgiving dinner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On receiving this award Campbell writes, “I am so grateful to my colleagues and students for taking the time to nominate me and so honored to be selected. Teaching and mentoring MIT students is such a joy. I am well aware that some students come through my door just to fulfill a requirement. Others come with genuine enthusiasm and interest. Either way, I love watching them discover how fascinating political science is and how relevant politics and policymaking are for their lives and their futures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emily Richmond Pollock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am truly thrilled to become a MacVicar Faculty Fellow. Working with the undergraduates at MIT is such a gift in itself. When I teach, I can only strive to match the students’ creativity and commitment with my own,” says Emily Richmond Pollock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollock joined MIT’s faculty in 2012. She received her BA in music from Harvard University in 2006 and her MA and PhD in music history and literature from the University of California at Berkeley in 2008 and 2012. She was awarded MIT’s Arthur C. Smith Award for meaningful contributions and devotion to undergraduate student life and learning in 2019 and the James A. and Ruth Levitan Teaching Award from the SHASS in 2020. She currently serves on the SOCR, the Subcommittee on the HASS requirements, and is the inaugural undergraduate chair in the SHASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollock is a dedicated mentor and advisor and testimonials highlight her commitment to student well-being and intellectual development. “Professor Emily Richmond Pollock is a kind, intentional, and dedicated teacher and advisor,” says senior Katherine Reisig. “By fostering such a welcoming community, she helps the MIT music department be a better place. It is clear … [she] cares deeply about her students, not only that we are doing well academically, but also that we are succeeding in life and doing well mentally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacVicar Faculty Fellow and associate professor of literature Marah Gubar agrees: “Emily has long served as a role model for how to support the ‘whole student’ in ways that build community, right wrongs, and infuse more humanity and beauty into our campus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT colleagues and students praise Pollock’s extensive contributions to curriculum development at the introductory and advanced levels. She regularly teaches class 21M.011 (Introduction to Western Music) and courses on opera, symphonic repertoire, and the advanced seminar for music majors. Her lectures provide lively learning experiences in which her students are encouraged to think critically about music and culture, dive into unfamiliar operas with curiosity, and compare dramatic elements across time periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I came away from 21M.011 not only with a better understanding of Western music, but with new curiosities and questions about music’s role in the world. Professor Pollock’s teaching made me want to learn more&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; it encouraged lifelong discovery, curiosity, and education,” Reisig says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Associate professor of music and MacVicar Faculty Fellow Patricia Tang writes, “Professor Pollock continues to grow as a leader in pedagogical innovation, transforming the music history curriculum and being a true inspiration to her colleagues in her devotion to her students. Though these subjects existed in the course catalog before Pollock’s arrival, in all cases she has radically transformed them, infusing new energy and excitement into the curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollock also champions issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts and is dedicated to making classical music and opera more accessible while maintaining the intellectual prestige applauded by students. She encourages students to embrace lesser-known works and step outside their comfort zone, even taking students to the opera herself. She has a “strong interest in anti-racist pedagogies and decolonizing music curriculum … [her] pedagogical innovations are numerous,” Tang observes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About her impact as an advisor, Tang notes: “Professor Pollock genuinely loves getting to know her students … it is really her ‘superpower.’ It is her mission to make sure [they] are not just surviving but thriving in their first year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Hana Ro agrees: “Under her guidance, my academic journey has been transformed, and I have gained not only a profound understanding of [this] subject matter but also a sense of belonging and encouragement that has been invaluable during my time at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Pollock ensures that students never feel isolated or alone. Graduate student Frederick Ajisafe says, “If she knew that a cohort was taking a demanding class, she would check in with us … In all cases, Emily emphasized her belief in our ability to succeed and her willingness to help us get there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vinod Vaikuntanathan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinod Vaikuntanathan is a professor in the Department of EECS. He received his bachelor’s degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in 2003 and his SM and PhD degrees in computer science from MIT in 2005 and 2009. Vaikuntanathan joined the faculty in 2013 and in recognition of his contributions to teaching and service to students, he received the Harold E. Edgerton Faculty Achievement Award in 2017 and the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Distinguished Teaching in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaikuntanathan has taught all three EECS undergraduate theoretical computer science subjects including 6.1210, formerly 6.006 (Introduction to Algorithms);&amp;nbsp;6.1200, formerly 6.042 (Mathematics for Computer Science); and&amp;nbsp;6.1220, formerly 6.046 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students say his classes are challenging, yet approachable and inclusive. Helen Propson ’24 writes,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“He excels at making&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;complex subjects like cryptography accessible and captivating for all students, creating an&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;atmosphere where every student’s input is highly regarded. He embraces questions and leaves students feeling inspired and motivated to tackle challenging problems, fostering a sense of confidence and a belief in their own abilities.” She goes on to say, “He often describes intricate concepts as ‘magical,’ and his enthusiasm is contagious, making the material come alive in the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT alumna Anne Kim concurs: “His teaching style is characterized by its clarity, enthusiasm, and a genuine passion for the subject matter. In his classes, he managed to distill complex algorithms into digestible concepts, making the material accessible to students with varying levels of expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaikuntanathan has also made significant contributions to the EECS curriculum. In spring 2022, he, along with fellow professors in the department, led an effort to improve 6.046. According to professor of EECS and MacVicar Fellow Srini Devadas, “designing a new lecture for 6.046 is not easy. Each new lecture is, typically, days of prep work, including preparing to … give the lecture itself and writing and testing problem set questions, quiz questions, and quiz practice questions. Vinod did all this with skill, aplomb, and enthusiasm. His contributions have had a permanent and beneficial effect on 6.046.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widely known for his work in cryptography, including homomorphic encryption and computational complexity, Vaikuntanathan became the lecturer-in-charge of the department’s first theoretical cryptography offering, 6.875. In addition, as the fields of quantum and post-quantum cryptography have grown, “Vinod has added relevant modules to the syllabus, taking the place of topics which had grown obsolete,” Devadas remarks. “Some professors might see teaching the same class multiple times as a chance to save themselves work by reusing the same materials. Vinod sees teaching 6.875 every fall as an opportunity to keep improving the class.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vinod Vaikuntanathan is also a devoted mentor and advisor, assisting with first-year UROPs and encouraging students to take advantage of his “open-door” policy. Kim writes that Professor Vaikuntanathan is benefiting her career still as “his mentorship ... extends beyond the classroom through his research” and that he “has mentored and advised dozens of [her] friends in the cryptography space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“His encouraging demeanor sets a remarkable example of the kind of teacher every student hopes to encounter during their academic career,” says Propson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On becoming a MacVicar Faculty Fellow Vaikuntanathan writes, “It is humbling to be in the company of such amazing teachers and mentors, many of whom I have come to think of as my role models. Many thanks to my colleagues and my students for considering me worthy of this honor.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/exposure-different-kinds-music-influences-how-brain-interprets-rhythm-0304</guid>
        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When listening to music, the human brain appears to be biased toward hearing and producing rhythms composed of simple integer ratios — for example, a series of four beats separated by equal time intervals (forming a 1:1:1 ratio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the favored ratios can vary greatly between different societies, according to a large-scale study led by researchers at MIT and the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and carried out in 15 countries. The study included 39 groups of participants, many of whom came from societies whose traditional music contains distinctive patterns of rhythm not found in Western music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides the clearest evidence yet for some degree of universality in music perception and cognition, in the sense that every single group of participants that was tested exhibits biases for integer ratios. It also provides a glimpse of the variation that can occur across cultures, which can be quite substantial,” says Nori Jacoby, the study’s lead author and a former MIT postdoc, who is now a research group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain’s bias toward simple integer ratios may have evolved as a natural error-correction system that makes it easier to maintain a consistent body of music, which human societies often use to transmit information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When people produce music, they often make small mistakes. Our results are consistent with the idea that our mental representation is somewhat robust to those mistakes, but it is robust in a way that pushes us toward our preexisting ideas of the structures that should be found in music,” says Josh McDermott, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McDermott is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01800-9" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour.&lt;/em&gt; The research team also included scientists from more than two dozen institutions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A global approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study grew out of a smaller analysis that Jacoby and McDermott published in 2017. In &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/how-brain-perceives-rhythm-1205" target="_blank"&gt;that paper&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers compared rhythm perception in groups of listeners from the United States and the Tsimane’, an Indigenous society located in the Bolivian Amazon rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure how people perceive rhythm, the researchers devised a task in which they play a randomly generated series of four beats and then ask the listener to tap back what they heard. The rhythm produced by the listener is then played back to the listener, and they tap it back again. Over several iterations, the tapped sequences became dominated by the listener’s internal biases, also known as priors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The initial stimulus pattern is random, but at each iteration the pattern is pushed by the listener’s biases, such that it tends to converge to a particular point in the space of possible rhythms,” McDermott says. “That can give you a picture of what we call the prior, which is the set of internal implicit expectations for rhythms that people have in their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the researchers first did this experiment, with American college students as the test subjects, they found that people tended to produce time intervals that are related by simple integer ratios. Furthermore, most of the rhythms they produced, such as those with ratios of 1:1:2 and 2:3:3, are commonly found in Western music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers then went to Bolivia and asked members of the Tsimane’ society to perform the same task. They found that Tsimane’ also produced rhythms with simple integer ratios, but their preferred ratios were different and appeared to be consistent with those that have been documented in the few existing records of Tsimane’ music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At that point, it provided some evidence that there might be very widespread tendencies to favor these small integer ratios, and that there might be some degree of cross-cultural variation. But because we had just looked at this one other culture, it really wasn’t clear how this was going to look at a broader scale,” Jacoby says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try to get that broader picture, the MIT team began seeking collaborators around the world who could help them gather data on a more diverse set of populations. They ended up studying listeners from 39 groups, representing 15 countries on five continents — North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is really the first study of its kind in the sense that we did the same experiment in all these different places, with people who are on the ground in those locations,” McDermott says. “That hasn’t really been done before at anything close to this scale, and it gave us an opportunity to see the degree of variation that might exist around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural comparisons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as they had in their original 2017 study, the researchers found that in every group they tested, people tended to be biased toward simple integer ratios of rhythm. However, not every group showed the same biases. People from North America and Western Europe, who have likely been exposed to the same kinds of music, were more likely to generate rhythms with the same ratios. However, many groups, for example those in Turkey, Mali, Bulgaria, and Botswana showed a bias for other rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are certain cultures where there are particular rhythms that are prominent in their music, and those end up showing up in the mental representation of rhythm,” Jacoby says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe their findings reveal a mechanism that the brain uses to aid in the perception and production of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you hear somebody playing something and they have errors in their performance, you’re going to mentally correct for those by mapping them onto where you implicitly think they ought to be,” McDermott says. “If you didn’t have something like this, and you just faithfully represented what you heard, these errors might propagate and make it much harder to maintain a musical system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the groups that they studied, the researchers took care to include not only college students, who are easy to study in large numbers, but also people living in traditional societies, who are more difficult to reach. Participants from those more traditional groups showed significant differences from college students living in the same countries, and from people who live in those countries but performed the test online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s very clear from the paper is that if you just look at the results from undergraduate students around the world, you vastly underestimate the diversity that you see otherwise,” Jacoby says. “And the same was true of experiments where we tested groups of people online in Brazil and India, because you’re dealing with people who have internet access and presumably have more exposure to Western music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers now hope to run additional studies of different aspects of music perception, taking this global approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re just testing college students around the world or people online, things look a lot more homogenous. I think it’s very important for the field to realize that you actually need to go out into communities and run experiments there, as opposed to taking the low-hanging fruit of running studies with people in a university or on the internet,” McDermott says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the James S. McDonnell Foundation, the Canadian National Science and Engineering Research Council, the South African National Research Foundation, the United States National Science Foundation, the Chilean National Research and Development Agency, the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the Keio Global Research Institute, the United Kingdom Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Swedish Research Council, and the John Fell Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Faces of MIT: Lydia Brosnahan </title>

  <description><![CDATA[The associate producer shares how arts initiatives bring different departments together in collaboration and community.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;A lot of behind-the-scenes work goes into creating an art installation or a theater production – not just by those making or performing their craft, but also by the staff members who coordinate the logistics of exhibits and events. One of the people at MIT who helps artists bring their projects to life is Lydia Brosnahan.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;In her role as associate producer in the Office of the Arts, Brosnahan works with several different arts initiatives including the MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology (CAST) and the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;“The arts at MIT are alive and well,” says Brosnahan, who has worked at the Institute for six years. “My job involves administering grants to faculty for their own artistic work as well as visiting artist residency projects where faculty members invite an artist to campus to collaborate with them, their students, and with the MIT community. Every visiting artist residency has some sort of public component, which could be an event or an activity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;It’s a collaborative effort in the Office of the Arts and the tasks of the department do not end with grant selection, distribution, and event execution. Brosnahan’s colleagues are also involved in student art programs, with running the MIT Arts Studios classes, and with the &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/start/wiesner-student-art-gallery/" target="_blank"&gt;Wiesner Student Art Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, which features exhibitions of artwork by MIT students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;“I also coordinate the CAMIT grants program, which primarily supports artistic projects by students,” Brosnahan explains. “Right now, for example, there is an exhibition in the Wiesner Student Art Gallery that was supported by a grant from CAMIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;“When I tell people outside of the Institute that I work in the arts at MIT they usually respond with, ‘There are arts programs at MIT?’ I think that is kind of the general impression. Outside of our visiting artists programs, we also have public art collections, architecture...there are so many student artists who are doing it as part of their career or to enhance their degree. There are theater groups who put on productions and organizations that take part in music and dance. I want people to know that the arts here are rich and amazing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;One of the projects Brosnahan is most proud to have worked in was part of a collaboration between CAST and the MIT Museum. “The first collaborative project that we did, that I got to help launch, was an exhibition called Arachnodrone. It's an installation that is based on research about spiderwebs and is a collaboration between engineers in civil and environmental engineering, researchers, and musicians who took the vibrational frequency of spiderwebs and turned it into music. It is both an installation and a performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;She also enjoys producing Arts on the Radar, a big kick-off celebration in the first week of September. “It is basically a way to say 'The arts are here. Come check them out!' We have demonstrations by students and collaborate with other arts units on campus including the List Visual Arts Center; the Art, Culture, and Technology program; the Department of Architecture; the Morningside Academy for Design; and Music and Theater Arts. We come together to throw a big party with the goal of helping people learn about what opportunities are available in the arts. It’s fun!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soundbytes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you like the most about your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brosnahan: &lt;/strong&gt;The people. Every project I work on is a little bit different because everyone who comes to us has a cool idea for a project. There is never a dull moment! Often there are projects that bring together art, science, and technology in new ways. I learn a lot just from being around interesting people and projects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: If someone was about to start working in MIT, what advice would you give them?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brosnahan:&lt;/strong&gt; Wander around campus. Get lost, explore, and try to meet people from every corner of MIT. When you start working here, there is a rush of new things to learn. It’s beneficial, and just great, to learn about everything going on here. I still find myself walking around, getting lost on campus, and discovering a different research lab I didn’t know about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Are you involved in any groups or clubs offered to staff members outside of your job?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brosnahan: &lt;/strong&gt;I'm a big fan of, and participant in, the &lt;a href="https://lce.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Language Conversation Exchange&lt;/a&gt;. LCE holds language lunches where you can sit at a specific language table and practice speaking that language with language learners and native speakers. They also have a program where you get matched with partners of MIT students, staff, and faculty as a one-on-one conversation partner. You note what language(s) you speak, which you want to learn, and then you can see if someone speaks one you want to learn. I'm really into foreign languages and I was excited to learn about that opportunity and get involved in the wider community.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seated at the grand piano in MIT’s Killian Hall last fall, first-year student Jacqueline Wang played through the lively opening of Mozart’s “Sonata in B-flat major, K.333.” When she’d finished, Mi-Eun Kim, pianist and lecturer in MIT’s Music and Theater Arts Section (MTA), asked her to move to the rear of the hall. Kim tapped at an iPad. Suddenly, the sonata she'd just played poured forth again from the piano — its keys dipping and rising just as they had with Wang’s fingers on them, the resonance of its strings filling the room. Wang stood among a row of empty seats with a slightly bemused expression, taking in a repeat of her own performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was a little strange,” Wang admitted when the playback concluded, then added thoughtfully: “It sounds different from what I imagine I’m playing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unusual lesson took place during a nearly three-week residency at MIT of the Steinway Spirio | r, a piano embedded with technology for live performance capture and playback. “The residency offered students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors the opportunity to engage with this new technology through a series of workshops that focused on such topics as the historical analysis of piano design, an examination of the hardware and software used by the Spirio | r, and step-by-step guidance of how to use the features,” explains Keeril Makan, head of MIT Music and Theater Arts and associate dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang was one of several residency participants to have the out-of-body experience of hearing herself play from a different vantage point, while watching the data of her performance scroll across a screen: color-coded rectangles indicating the velocity and duration of each note, an undulating line charting her use of the damper pedal. Wang was even able to edit her own performance, as she discovered when Kim suggested her rhythmic use of the pedal might be superfluous. Using the iPad interface to erase the pedaling entirely, they listened to the playback again, the notes gaining new clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“See? We don’t need it,” Kim confirmed with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When MIT’s new music building (W18) opens in spring 2025, we hope it will include this type of advanced technology. It would add value not just to Wang’s cohort of 19 piano students in the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study"&gt;Emerson/Harris Program&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a total of 71 scholars and fellows with support for conservatory-level instruction in classical, jazz, and world music. But could also offer educational opportunities to a much wider swath of the MIT community,” says Makan. “Music is the fifth-most popular minor at MIT; 1,700 students enroll in music and theater arts classes each semester, and the Institute is brimming with vocalists, composers, instrumentalists, and music history students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Kim, the Spirio enables insights beyond what musicians could learn from a conventional recording; hearing playback directly from the instrument reveals sonic dimensions an MP3 can’t capture. “Speaker systems sort of crunch everything down — the highs and the lows, they all kind of sound the same. But piano solo music is very dynamic. It’s supposed to be experienced in a room,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Spirio | r residency, students found they could review their playing at half speed, adjust the volume of certain notes to emphasize a melody, transpose a piece to another key, or layer their performance — prerecording one hand, for example, then accompanying it live with the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It helps the student be part of the learning and the teaching process,” Kim says. “If there’s a gap between what they imagined and what they hear and then they come to me and say, ‘How do I fix this?’ they’re definitely more engaged. It’s an honest representation of their playing, and the students who are humbled by it will become better pianists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Wang, reflecting on her lesson with Kim, the session introduced an element she’d never experienced since beginning her piano studies at age 5. “The visual display of how long each key was played and with what velocity gave me a more precise demonstration of the ideas of voicing and evenness,” Wang says. “Playing the piano is usually dependent solely on the ears, but this combines with the auditory experience a visual experience and statistics, which helped me get a more holistic view of my playing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first-year undergraduate considering a Course 6 major (electrical engineering and computer science, or EECS), Wang was also fascinated to watch Patrick Elisha, a representative from Steinway dealer M. Steinert &amp;amp; Sons, disassemble the piano action to point out the optical sensors that measure the velocity of each hammer strike at 1,020 levels of sensitivity, sampled 800 times per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was amazed by the precision of the laser sensors and inductors,” says Wang. “I have just begun to take introductory-level courses in EECS and am just coming across these concepts, and this certainly made me more excited to learn more about these electrical devices and their applications. I was also intrigued that the electrical system was added onto the piano without interfering with the mechanical structure, so that when we play the Spirio, our experience with the touch and finger control was just like that of playing a usual Steinway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Emerson/Harris scholar, Víctor Quintas-Martínez, a PhD candidate in economics who resumed his lapsed piano studies during the Covid-19 pandemic, visited Killian Hall during the residency to rehearse a Fauré piano quartet with a cellist, violist, and violinist. “We did a run of certain passages and recorded the piano part. Then I listened to the strings play with the recording from the back of the hall. That gave me an idea of what I needed to adjust in terms of volume, texture, pedal, etc., to achieve a better balance. Normally, when you’re playing, because you’re sitting behind the strings and close to the piano, your perception of balance may be somewhat distorted,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kim cites another campus demographic ripe for exploring these types of instruments like the Spirio | r and its software: future participants in MIT’s relatively new Music Technology Master's Program, along with others across the Institute whose work intersects with the wealth of data the instrument captures. Among them is Praneeth Namburi, a research scientist at the MIT.nano Immersion Lab. Typically, Namburi focuses his neuroscience expertise on the biomechanics of dancing and expert movement. For two days during the MTA/Spirio residency, he used the sensors at the Immersion Lab, along with those of the Spirio, to analyze how pianists use their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We used motion capture that can help us contrast the motion paths of experts such as Mi-Eun from those of students, potentially aiding in music education,” Namburi recounts, “force plates that can give scientific insights into how movement timing is organized, and ultrasound to visualize the forearm tissues during playing, which can potentially help us understand musicianship-related injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The encounter between MTA and MIT.nano was something unique to MIT,” Kim believes. “Not only is this super useful for the music world, but it’s also very exciting for movement researchers, because playing piano is one of the most complex activities that humans do with our hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kim’s view, that quintessentially human complexity is complemented by these kinds of technical possibilities. “Some people might think oh, it's going to replace the pianist,” she says. “But in the end it is a tool. It doesn’t replace all of the things that go into learning music. I think it's going to be an invaluable third partner: the student, the teacher, and the Spirio — or the musician, the researcher, and the Spirio. It's going to play an integral role in a lot of musical endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts Assistant Professor Miguel Zenón has won a Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Album for his work on “El Arte Del Bolero Vol. 2.” Zenón recorded the album with Luis Perdomo, a follow-up to their critically-acclaimed “El Arte Del Bolero Vol. 1.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m incredibly happy and honored with this Grammy win,” says Zenón, a 12-time Grammy nominee. “We’ve been making albums for a long time, so it’s extremely rewarding to earn this recognition. This will certainly be an incentive to keep moving forward and creating more music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album’s title references the beauty of the Latin-American Songbook and the Bolero in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Latin-American Songbook is so vast and varied that it naturally lends itself to limitless explorations,” says Zenón in the album's liner notes. “We purposely looked beyond the Caribbean (exploring composers from México, Venezuela and Panamá, for example) because we wanted to emphasize the point that these songs deserved to be explored and recognized for what they are, beyond labels, categories, and regionalisms. Just beautiful music that is a joy to perform and listen to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics lauded the album, naming it the top Latin Jazz recording of 2023 in the Jazz Critics Poll.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In an extraordinary follow-up to 'El Arte Del Bolero Vol. 1,' these timeless tunes are slowed down, blended with unusual elements, played out of time, deconstructed and reconstructed as Zenón and Perdomo extract nuances from the originals that we hardly imagined could exist,” said critic Catalina Maria Johnson.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Zenón has recorded and toured with a wide variety of musicians including Charlie Haden, Fred Hersch, David Sánchez, Danilo Pérez, Kenny Werner, Bobby Hutcherson, and The SFJAZZ Collective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A renowned saxophonist, Zenón joined the MIT faculty in 2023 as an assistant professor of jazz. He is also the current visiting scholar for the Harmony and Jazz Composition Department at Berklee College of Music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Zenón received a fellowship from the prestigious John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. Also that year, he received the coveted MacArthur Fellowship, also known as the “genius grant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Zenón founded Caravana Cultural, a program that presents free-of-charge Jazz concerts in rural areas of Puerto Rico. In 2022, he also received an honorary doctorate from La Universidad del Sagrado Corazón in San Juan, the highest honor bestowed by the institution.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A night at the orchestra, with Pokémon on the program</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT student musicians blend longtime passions as they arrange and perform the music of beloved video games.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Around 50 musicians crowd the well-lit Kresge Auditorium stage. They wear formal black attire and concentrated facial expressions. As the conductor carefully raises her baton, the audience comes to a perfect silence. A single piano lets forth a delicate cascade of high-pitched notes and is soon joined by a dozen violins that burst into a catchy, fast-paced melody. Many audience members look at their friends and smile. They recognize the tune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 90-minute performance goes on to incorporate saxophones, cellos, percussion instruments, a French horn, and a variety of other instruments. But with due respect to Beethoven and Bach, their work did not make the program on this night. Instead, the orchestra offered emotionally stirring renditions of songs from video games like “Mario Kart”, “Plants vs. Zombies,” and “Pokémon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/mitvgo" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Video Game Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;, a student-led group dedicated to performing original arrangements of video game music, film soundtracks, and other kinds of music not usually heard in concert halls. The group performs at least two concerts a year, and all arrangements are written by members of the orchestra and tailored to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the performances, the group also runs workshops to help members develop their skills, provides soundtracks and introductions for events, and hosts socials featuring film screenings and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really cool that there are so many genres that fall under the umbrella term of video game music,” says junior Lynn Jung, who serves a co-music director of the group. “It allows you to explore different musical avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members of the group grew up learning classical instruments and playing classical music. The Video Game Orchestra gives them the opportunity to break that mold and play music more in line with their interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was definitely into video game music growing up,” says Alex Wardle, a junior who is in charge of managing the group’s library of music. “I listened to it a lot in high school and I really wanted to perform it, but I didn't have the opportunity. None of the music groups that I joined would cover modern soundtracks. I always wished there was an opportunity for me to get to play some of the pieces I really love.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group’s organizers are quick to point out that a love for video games is not a requirement for joining. Some students join because they want to continue playing their instruments in a more casual environment. But many came to the Video Game Orchestra to merge two longtime hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was more into playing video games than listening to them, but at the audition, I remember saying, ‘I like video games and I like music, so I will definitely like video game music,’" Jung recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the tunes, there are several key differences between the group and a traditional orchestra, the largest being the open approach to preparing the arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a more collaborative environment, where it’s less the conductors choosing the music we play and more of a community effort based on the pieces we like as a community,” Wardle says. “Through our feedback process with arrangements, it becomes this group effort in which everyone’s working together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of that process is inviting students to try their hand at writing music through workshops each semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a little background in writing music. I loved listening to videogame music and I’d played for quite a while, but I definitely hadn’t done anything like an orchestral arrangement,” Wardle says. “By playing student-made arrangements my first year, I realized I could do something like that. There were people I could reach out to, like other students, who had done it in the past, so I jumped straight in and have been pushing out arrangements ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members joined because they loved making music and video games, but they say they’ve stayed because of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A big reason I’ve stayed in VGO is the community and the people,” says Ishika Shah, a senior who serves as the group’s co-music director. “It’s been a great way to meet new people and join a community I’ve really enjoyed being a part of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group’s organizers encourage participants to mingle outside of their instrument section, and rehearsals are often interspersed with casual talk of music and video games. But the music and performances are still taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerts have had as many as 200 attendees — with many more watching online (the group’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mitvgo" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; features most performances). Renditions of emotional pieces have sometimes moved people to tears, and because many people attend out of an interest in video games, the group attracts a broader audience to orchestral music than traditional symphony orchestras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to classically orchestrated headliners, the orchestra also plays pieces that feature more rock or jazz and that get people dancing and clapping along. In one performance of a karaoke favorite, “Baka Mitai” (or “I’ve Been a Fool” in Japanese), the orchestra invited the audience to sing along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orchestra’s decisions are guided by whatever sounds fun — and for the people that don’t put video game music in the same class as Beethoven, the group believes they’re adding credibility to a perhaps underrated genre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I think at the end of the day what I care about when I am listening to music or playing music is just that the music resonates with me in some way, or that it’s fun to listen to or fun to play,” Jung says. “For some people, that might be classical music, but for me that happens to be a lot of video game music.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;John LaBoiteaux Buttrick, a former professor in MIT’s Music and Theater Arts Section and prize-winning pianist, died in late November, 2023, in Zurich, Switzerland. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick joined the humanities faculty at MIT in 1966, where he lectured and taught as a professor of humanities and music. He served as the head of MIT’s music section from 1967 to 1976. He taught introduction to music subjects as part of the humanities requirement and was, according to colleague and MIT professor Marcus Thompson, “very popular.”&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick was born Dec. 15, 1934. He grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, and Nantucket, Massachusetts. He spent a year at Haverford College before later earning a BS in 1957 and an MS in 1959 from the Juilliard School of Music. He completed additional graduate work at Brandeis University. During his personal and professional career, he studied piano with Isidor Philipp, Rudolf Serkin, and Beveridge Webster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Buttrick’s first professional outings was as a participant in the Marlboro Music Festival.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1961 he toured major European cities performing in recitals and as a soloist with symphony orchestras. Critics from news organizations in Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Zurich lauded his “technical and musical prowess and his communicative gift.” He also toured with orchestras and groups across the United States and Europe for most of his life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his tenure at MIT, Buttrick performed numerous solo recitals in Kresge Auditorium, favoring Beethoven. He was also a soloist with the MIT Symphony Orchestra on a national tour to several major American cities. The tour was hosted by the MIT Alumni Association and conducted by Professor Emeritus &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2002/epstein"&gt;David Epstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine reported that, under Buttrick’s leadership, MIT saw its music faculty more than double to 13 and oversaw the increasing popularity of its music courses; two-thirds of the 1973 sophomore class enrolled in them. The Institute’s student orchestra, under Buttrick’s direction, regularly sold out the Kresge Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick, alongside MIT students, was also featured in a weekly radio program, “After Dinner,” which was broadcast on station WGBH in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The program featured “informal, four-handed playing of pieces by Mozart and Schubert.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was frequently featured in chamber music presentations on MIT’s campus accompanied by other prominent artists like French flutist and Marlboro School of Music co-founder Louis Moyse, son of the famous flutist Marcel Moyse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick was passionate about his musical forebears, particularly Beethoven. The liner notes Buttrick wrote for his 1983 album&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; “Ludwig von Beethoven: Klaviersonate Nr. 30 E-Dur, Op. 109 - Klaviersonate Nr. 31 As-Dur, Op. 110”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; released in Switzerland on the label Jecklin Musikhaus, described Beethoven’s sounds as “melodic shapes and figurations” and “rounder and more undulant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick recorded several other albums of music by Franz Schubert, &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Busoni-Ferruccio.htm"&gt;Ferruccio Busoni&lt;/a&gt;, Joseph Haydn, &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Reger-Max.htm"&gt;Max Reger&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Strauss, &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Brahms-Johannes.htm"&gt;Johannes Brahms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Beethoven.htm"&gt;L.van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Franck-Cesar.htm"&gt;César Franck&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bach-cantatas.com/Lib/Chopin-Frederic.htm"&gt;Frédéric Chopin&lt;/a&gt;. His favorite composers were Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, and Chopin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick believed in music’s power to heal people. A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqmxswqWZWU"&gt;former student of Joseph Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, Buttrick&amp;nbsp; healed after suffering significant injuries to his hand, arm, and shoulder. Later, he came to practice &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476461/"&gt;movement therapy&lt;/a&gt;, helping clients avoid surgery using alternative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While living in America, he was active on Nantucket and a member of the Congregational Church, where many passersby could hear him practicing the piano any given weekday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1985, John relocated to Zurich, where he continued to teach, perform, and engage in the arts. While in Zurich, he met and later married Irene Buttrick. He officially took leave of his MIT position in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buttrick is survived by his children, Miriam, David, Simon, and Michael; five grandchildren; ex-wife and caregiver Irene; brothers Daniel Drake and Hoyt Drake; and numerous beloved nieces and nephews.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More than 1,500 students enroll in music classes each year at MIT. More than 500 student musicians participate in one of 30 on-campus ensembles. In spring 2025, to better provide for its thriving musical program, MIT will inaugurate its new music building, a 35,000-square-foot three-volume facility adjacent to Kresge Auditorium. The new building will feature high-quality rehearsal and performance spaces, a professional recording studio, classrooms, and laboratories for the music technology program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeril Makan is the Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor, section head of the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section (MTA), and was recently named associate dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. A celebrated composer, Makan has been instrumental in the conception and realization of the &lt;a href="https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/music-building" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Music Building&lt;/a&gt;, which will also be known as Building W18. He speaks here about the ways that music helps MIT broaden and fulfill its mission, and the opportunities that the new facilities will provide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; After many years of planning, the MIT Music Building is taking shape. How will this new facility change the MIT experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;There is a tremendous demand on campus for the opportunity to make music and to listen to live music. Some of our students arrive at MIT already planning to study and perform music. Others pick up the passion on campus. We have such a flourishing music community here, with so many different types of ensembles we want to support. In addition to the Western Classical tradition, like our orchestra or wind ensemble, where we’ve always been strong, there is also a strong interest in jazz on campus. In fact, we’ve just hired our first jazz professor, Miguel Zenón. More and more students want to explore and experience music from other cultures. We have our Balinese Gamelan, as well as Rambax, a Senegalese drumming group that has the second-largest enrollment for an ensemble, after our orchestra. Our building is designed to allow all of these different musical traditions to exist simultaneously, all equally respected and supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such a strong interest in music among our students and MIT community, the Institute is providing the proper facilities where students and faculty can pursue and develop that interest. And a big part of that is proper acoustics. At MIT we have laboratory spaces that provide stringent environmental conditions for temperature, humidity, vibration, and particulate control. Otherwise, the samples can be contaminated, and the results altered. It’s the same thing in music — we need acoustically controlled rehearsal spaces where the students hear and perform music without contamination from other sound sources. Our performance hall is designed for the audience to hear the music exactly the way the performers hear it. They will experience the music together, in a space that fosters intimacy between the performers and their audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Will the new music building attract a different type of student to MIT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m not sure whether the new facility will attract a different type of student as much as keep MIT competitive in attracting the type of student who will thrive here. Undergraduates and graduate students have come to expect state-of-the-art facilities across the board for their work in STEM, but also for the parts of their lives that support or complement that work. Music is a big part of that support at MIT. In order for us to stay competitive, to continue to attract the students we believe will help us further our mission, we needed to raise the bar in terms of the level of support we offer students in music. But it’s not just about being competitive in attracting gifted students. Part of our work here is taking on and providing solutions to some of the world’s most pressing and complex challenges. Solving those problems, of course, requires technical expertise. But it also requires wisdom, emotion, and compassion. Empathizing with other members of our community can lead to solutions that will make all of our lives better. And while it’s important that this new building keeps us competitive as an institution, it’s even more important for it to keep us competitive in creating the types of people best suited to take on the world’s great problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How can music, and other arts, complement and support a student’s work in science and technology?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Making music is a physical activity. There is something about the small motions of the fingers, the voice resonating, that affects the body, that connects the body with what you are experiencing or feeling. It pulls you completely into the now. Having this building, right in the middle of our campus, makes it clear that this centering is important to MIT and its mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the students rehearsing and performing in the building, or the students who compose music for our new facility, or for the students who will develop the hardware and software that engineers will use to produce music, the problem-solving inherent in those activities is very similar to what they do in STEM. Both are creative processes, where you learn to evaluate, manage, and integrate multiple parameters. Creating music or music technology requires you to rotate a series of different problems in your mind, and to devise a way for them to fit together. It fosters an internal desire for discovery, and for creativity. All of these are skills that, when mastered, easily translate into other activities, including scientific research, math, or engineering. MIT understands that music, and all the arts, are essential in helping our students take on the many challenges facing our world, like the climate crisis, or the impact of AI. Not just in creating an awareness of our humanity, but in training the minds and hearts of the people who will solve those issues. We now have the building that will support that crucial education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>MIT Music and Theater Arts</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 13, the MIT community came together for the premiere of “We Are The Forest,” a documentary by MIT Video Productions that tells the story of the MIT musicians who traveled to the Brazilian Amazon seeking culture and scientific exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film features performances by Djuena Tikuna, Luciana Souza, Anat Cohen,&amp;nbsp;and Evan Ziporyn, with music by Antônio Carlos Jobim.&amp;nbsp;Fred Harris conducts the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble and MIT Wind Ensemble and Laura Grill Jaye conducts the MIT Vocal&amp;nbsp;Jazz Ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of ecological devastation in the Amazon reflects the climate crisis worldwide.&amp;nbsp;During the Institute's spring break in March 2023, nearly 80 student musicians became only the second student group from MIT to travel to the Brazilian Amazon.&amp;nbsp;Inspired by the research and activism of Talia Khan ’20, who is currently a PhD candidate in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering, the trip built upon experiences of the 2020-21 academic year when virtual visiting artists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lucianasouza.com/"&gt;Luciana Souza&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.anatcohen.com/"&gt;Anat Cohen&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;lectured on Brazilian music and culture before joining the November 2021 launch of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/hearing-amazonia-program-2023/" target="_blank"&gt;Hearing Amazônia — The Responsibility of Existence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consciousness-raising project at MIT, sponsored by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/cast/"&gt;Center for Art, Science and Technology &lt;/a&gt;(CAST), began with a concert featuring Brazilian and Amazonian music influenced by the natural world. The project was created and led by MIT director of wind and jazz ensembles and senior lecturer in music &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/fred-harris"&gt;Frederick Harris Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance was part eulogy and part praise song: a way of bearing witness to loss, while celebrating the living and evolving cultural heritage of Amazonia. The event included short talks, one of which was by Khan. As the first MIT student to study in the Brazilian Amazonia (via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-brazil"&gt;MISTI-Brazil&lt;/a&gt;), she spoke of her research on natural botanical resins and traditional carimbó music in Santarém, Pará, Brazil. Soon after, as a Fulbright Scholar, Khan continued her research in Manaus, setting the stage for the most complex trip in the history of &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“My experiences in the Brazilian Amazon changed my life,” enthuses Khan. “Getting to know Indigenous musicians and immersing myself in the culture of this part of the world helped me realize how we are all so connected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Talia’s experiences in Brazil convinced me that the Hearing Amazônia project needed to take a next essential step,” explains Harris. “I wanted to provide as many students as possible with a similar opportunity to bring their musical and scientific talents together in a deep and spiritual manner. She provided a blueprint for our trip to Manaus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An experience of a lifetime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multitude of musicians from three MTA ensembles traveled to Manaus, located in the middle of the world’s largest rainforest and home to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.br/inpa/pt-br"&gt;National Institute of Amazonian Research&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, or&amp;nbsp;INPA), the most important center for scientific studies in the Amazon region for international sustainability issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tour experiences included cultural/scientific exchanges with Indigenous Amazonians through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nobreacademia.com/"&gt;Nobre Academia de Robótica&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the São Sebastião community on the Tarumã&amp;nbsp;Açu River, INPA, the Cultural Center of the Peoples of the Amazon, and the &lt;a href="https://museudaamazonia.org.br/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Museu da Amazônia&lt;/a&gt;. Musically, students connected with local Indigenous instrument builders and performed with the Amazonas State Jazz Orchestra and renowned vocalist and Indigenous activist &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/djuenatikuna"&gt;Djuena Tikuna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hearing Amazônia: Arte ê&amp;nbsp;Resistência,” a major concert in the famed 19th century opera house Teatro Amazonas, concluded the trip on March 31. The packed event featured the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-wind-ensemble"&gt;MIT Wind Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/festival-jazz-ensemble"&gt;MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-vocal-jazz-ensemble"&gt;MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;, vocalist Luciana Souza, clarinetist Anat Cohen, MIT professor and composer-clarinetist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ziporyn.com/"&gt;Evan Ziporyn&lt;/a&gt;, and local musicians from Manaus. The program ended with “Nós Somos A Floresta (We Are The Forest) — Eware (Sacred Land) — Reflections on Amazonia&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a large-scale collaborative performance with Djuena Tikuna. The two songs were composed by Tikuna, with Eware newly arranged by&amp;nbsp;Israeli composer-bassist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlSuCYvh4mY"&gt;Nadav Erlich&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the occasion. It concluded with all musicians and audience members coming together in song: a moving and beautiful moment of mediation on the sacredness of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was humbling to see the grand display of beauty and diversity that nature developed in the Amazon rainforest,” reflects bass clarinetist and MIT sophomore Richard Chen. “By seeing the bird life, sloths, and other species and the flora, and eating the fruits of the region, I received lessons on my harmony and connection to the natural world around us. I developed a deeper awareness of the urgency of resolving conflicts and stopping the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and to listening to and celebrating the stories and experiences of those around me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigenous musicians embodying the natural world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The trip expanded the scope of what music means,” MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble member and biomedical researcher Autumn Geil explains. “It’s living the music, and you can’t feel that unless you put yourself in new experiences and get yourself out of your comfort zone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over two Indigenous music immersion days, students spent time listening to, and playing and singing with, musicians who broadened their scope of music’s relationship to nature and cultural sustainability. Indigenous percussionist and instrument builder Eliberto Barroncas&amp;nbsp;and music producer-arranger César Lima presented contrasting approaches with a shared objective — connecting people to the natural world through Indigenous instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barroncas played instruments built from materials from the rainforest and from found objects in Manaus that others might consider trash, creating ethereal tones bespeaking his life as one with nature. Students had the opportunity to play his instruments and create a spontaneous composition playing their own instruments and singing with him in a kind of “Amazonia jam session.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eliberto expressed that making music is visceral; it’s best when it comes from the gut and is tangible and coming from one’s natural environment. When we cannot understand each other using language, using words, logic and thinking, we go back to the body,” notes oboist and ocean engineer Michelle Kornberg ’20. “There's a difference between teaching music as a skill you learn and teaching music as something you feel, that you experience and give — as a gift.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the pandemic, César Lima developed an app, “The Roots VR,” as a vehicle for people to discover over 100 Amazonia instruments. Users choose settings to interact with instruments and create pieces using a variety of instrumental combinations; a novel melding of technology with nature to expand the reach of these Indigenous instruments and their cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Cultural Center of the Peoples of the Amazon, students gathered around a tree, hand-in-hand singing with Djuena Tikuna, accompanied by percussionist Diego Janatã. “She spoke about being one of the first Indigenous musicians ever to sing in the Teatro Amazonas, which was built on the labor and blood of Indigenous people,” recalls flutist and atmospheric engineer Phoebe Lin, an MIT junior. “And then to hold hands and close our eyes and step back and forth; a rare moment of connection in a tumultuous world — it felt like we were all one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing the forest back to MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 29, Djuena Tikuna made her MIT debut at “&lt;a href="http://inauguration.mit.edu/we-are-the-forest"&gt;We Are the Forest — Music of Resilience and Activism&lt;/a&gt;,” a special concert for MIT President Sally Kornbluth’s inauguration, presenting music from the Teatro Amazonas event. Led and curated by Harris, the performance included new assistant professor in jazz and saxophonist-composer&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://miguelzenon.com/"&gt;Miguel Zenón&lt;/a&gt;, director of the MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble; &lt;a href="https://lauragrilljaye.com/"&gt;Laura Grill Jaye&lt;/a&gt;; and vocalist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.saraserpa.com/"&gt;Sara Serpa&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Music unites people and through art we can draw the world’s attention to the most urgent global challenges such as climate change,” says Djuena Tikuna. “My songs bring the message that every seed will one day germinate to reforest hearts, because we are all from the same village.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing Amazônia has set the stage for the blossoming of artistic and scientific collaborations in the Amazon and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The struggle of Indigenous peoples to keep their territories alive should concern us all, and it will take more than science and research to help find solutions for climate change,” notes President Kornbluth. “It will take artists, too, to unite us and raise awareness across all communities.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;inclusivity and expressive power of music can help get us all rowing in the same direction — it’s a great way to encourage us all to care and act!”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you cross MIT student and alumni raps with other community members’ electronic dance music, rhythmic riddles, and heartfelt love songs? You get MITverses, a new spoken-word musical collaboration sponsored by the MIT Music Production Collaborative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community members from across the Institute were invited to record their singing, vocal loops, and other spoken word music to the project, which was recently published as a compilation on SoundCloud and Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Usually projects are just for the students or just for the faculty, so it feels nice to cut across some of those invisible boundaries,” says organizer Angela Chang ’97, SM ’02, PhD ’11, an affiliate researcher with MIT Trope Tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project builds on a similar effort over Independent Activities Period (IAP) last year, in which students were encouraged to contribute to a musical collaboration. Chang wanted to expand on that, partially inspired by her experience sitting in on a course taught by Grammy Award-winning rapper and MLK Visiting Scholar Wasalu “Lupe Fiasco” Jaco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a place of collaboration on all fronts — individual moments of creative force and potential combine to produce mass effect,” Jaco says in a textual intro to the album. “The MITverses projects calls together those independent forces operating in and around MIT into combination. Multidimensional and analytical with heart and soul looking into the past and future through the lenses of imagination attenuated by infinite corridors of possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allow="autoplay" frameborder="no" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1712862975&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&amp;amp;visual=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chang received help from a number of community members to organize the submissions. The project also included several workshops over the summer in which drafts were shared and artists were given feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was excited about it because I see the potential within MIT,” senior Andoni Chiu says. “I see a lot of people excited about trying these sorts of things, some really funny and talented people with a lot to bring to the table.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result is an eclectic, wide-ranging compilation of music, including an electronic dance track from Moises Trejo ’22, a pair of love songs from Paul Schindler ’74, a Pi-themed drill song from Thomas Hafer ’70, and raps from PhD candidate Alex Brinson, Chiu, and Curtis Northcutt SM ’17, PhD ’21, who has previously called for more college students to rap about their schools and was another inspiration for the MITverses project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants included Indi Williams from MIT Open Learning, who helped with infrastructure, and friends of MIT students who also consider themselves members of the MIT community, including music producer Gabriel Luansing, aka Mr. Master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each member of the project contributed for their own reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would love to have a proper hip hop scene at MIT,” says Brinson, whose &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gHNSRz5pm0"&gt;nuclear physics raps&lt;/a&gt; have gone viral. “I’d like more people to bounce really esoteric, niche bars around with. I know people who know STEM but don’t make music, and I know people who make music but the physics concepts are lost on them. It would be nice to have more people who appreciate both.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others talked about strengthening connections across campus and making STEM topics more fun and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s surprising this hasn’t already happened,” Chiu said before the final product was released. “It gives people an outlet and a way of expressing themselves through music. It’s a place to say things and be heard. I hope something ridiculous and totally unforeseen comes from this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chang was thrilled with the response from the community and would like to do something similar again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As I learned more about the people who wanted to collaborate, what I found is they want to give back to the community,” Chang says. “People are giving back in the way that makes the most sense to them. It’s interesting and heartwarming.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 11 faculty were granted tenure in the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/isaiah-andrews"&gt;Isaiah Andrews&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’14 is a professor in the Department of Economics. He is an econometrician who develops reliable and broadly applicable methods of statistical inference to address key challenges in economics, social science, and medicine. He is the recipient of the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal, a MacArthur Fellowship, and a Sloan Research Fellowship. Andrews earned his PhD in economics from MIT and served as an assistant and associate professor in the Department of Economics from 2016 to 2018. He returned to MIT as a full professor in 2023 after spending five years at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/joshua-bennett/"&gt;Joshua Bennett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a professor in the MIT Literature Section and Distinguished Chair of the Humanities. He is the author of five books of poetry, criticism, and narrative nonfiction, including most recently "Spoken Word: A Cultural History" (Knopf, 2023) and&lt;em&gt; "&lt;/em&gt;The Study of Human Life" (Penguin, 2022), which is being adapted for television in collaboration with Warner Brothers Studios. He earned his PhD in English from Princeton University, and an MA in theater and performance studies from the University of Warwick, where he was a Marshall Scholar. For his creative writing and scholarship, Bennett has received fellowships and awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Whiting Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/megan-a-black/"&gt;Megan Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the MIT History Section. She is a historian of U.S. environmental management and foreign relations in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Her interests span the fields of environmental history, foreign relations history, history of capitalism, science and technology studies, and histories of the U.S. West. She is the author of "The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power," which analyzes the surprising role of the U.S. Department of the Interior in pursuing minerals around the world&amp;nbsp;— in Indigenous lands, formal territories, foreign nations, the oceans, and outer space. The work garnered four prizes in different subfields. Professor Black previously taught at the London School of Economics and completed postdoctoral fellowships at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University and the John Sloane Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College. She earned her BA from the University of Nebraska and her PhD from George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/william-deringer/"&gt;William Deringer&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. His research examines the history of those techniques and technologies of calculation that organize modern economic, financial, and political life. His work ranges widely across time, from early compound-interest tables and changing social relations in the English countryside in the early 1600s to the place of computer spreadsheets in the culture of Wall Street in the “go-go” 1980s. Deringer received his BA summa cum laude in history from Harvard University in 2006, and his MA (2009) and PhD (2012) in history of science from Princeton University. Before graduate school, he was an investment banking analyst at the Blackstone Group in New York. At Princeton, he was awarded the Porter Ogden Jacobus Fellowship, Princeton’s highest honor for graduate students. From 2012 to 2015, he was a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University, before joining the MIT faculty in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/green/"&gt;E.J. Green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy and the Class of 1948 Career Development Chair. He joined the MIT faculty in 2017. He received his PhD from Rutgers University in 2016, then spent a year as a postdoc at New York University before arriving at MIT. His research interests are in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science, with a primary focus on perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nathaniel-hendren"&gt;Nathaniel Hendren&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’12 is a professor in the Department of Economics. His research quantifies the differences in economic mobility and opportunity for people of different backgrounds, explores why private markets often fail to provide economic opportunity, and offers new tools for government policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of social programs. Hendren founded and co-directs Policy Impacts and Opportunity Insights. He has received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and a Sloan Research Fellowship. Hendren earned his PhD in economics from MIT and returned as a full professor in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/caley-horan/"&gt;Caley Horan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the History Section. She is an historian of the 20th century United States interested in the social life of economic ideas. Her research and teaching focus on business history and the history of capitalism, risk and uncertainty, and American culture in the post-1945 era. Her first book "Insurance Era: Risk, Governance, and the Privatization of Security in Postwar America,"&amp;nbsp;won the 2022 Hagley Prize for best book in business history. "Insurance Era&lt;em&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;examines the role of the insurance industry in shaping social, political, and economic life in the United States during the second half of the 20th century. Horan is currently at work on a new project on the history of astrology and uncertainty in the modern United States. She earned her BA from Stanford University in 2003, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota in 2011.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/robin-scheffler/"&gt;Robin Wolfe Scheffler&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. He is an historian of the modern biological and biomedical sciences and their intersections with developments in American history. The common aim of his projects is to show the mutual influence of society on science and science on society. His first book, "A Contagious Cause: The American Hunt for Cancer Viruses and the Rise of Molecular Medicine," follows the history of cancer virus research from laboratory to legislature, showing the intimate connections between health policy and the emergence of a molecular vision of life. He is currently at work on a National Science Foundation-supported project to write the first history of the Boston-area biotechnology cluster and the spatial relationships between technological innovation and the production of inequality. He earned undergraduate degrees in history and chemistry from the University of Chicago, an M.Phil in the history and philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge, and a doctorate from Yale University in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[The iconic sci-fi opera “VALIS,” first composed by Professor Tod Machover in 1987, reboots at MIT for a new generation.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1980s, composer Tod Machover came across a copy of Philip K. Dick’s science fiction novel “VALIS” in a Parisian bookstore. Based on a mystical vision Dick called his “pink light experience,” “VALIS” was an acronym for “vast active living intelligence system.” The metaphysical novel would become the basis for Machover’s opera of the same name, which first premiered at the Pompidou Center in 1987, and was recently re-staged at MIT for a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, Machover was in his 20s and the director of musical research at the renowned French Institute IRCAM, a hotbed of the avant-garde known for its pioneering research in music technology. The Pompidou, Machover says, had given him carte blanche to create a new piece for its 10th anniversary. So, throughout the summer and fall, the composer had gone about constructing an elaborate theater inside the center’s cavernous entrance hall, installing speakers and hundreds of video monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the first computer opera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machover, who is now Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media and director of the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future research group, had originally wanted to use IRCAM founder Pierre Boulez’s Ensemble Intercontemporain, but was turned down when he asked to rehearse with them for a full two months. “Like a rock band,” he says. “I went back and thought, ‘Well, what’s the smallest number of players that can make and generate the richness and layered complexity of music that I was thinking about?’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He decided his orchestra would consist of only two musicians: a keyboardist and a percussionist. With tools like personal computers, MIDI, and the DX7 newly available, the possibilities of digital sound and intelligent interaction were beginning to expand. Soon, Machover took a position as a founding faculty member of MIT’s Media Lab, shuttling back and forth between Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Paris. “That’s when we invented hyperinstruments,” says Machover. The hyperinstruments, developed at the Media Lab in collaboration with Machover’s very first graduate student RA Joe Chung, allowed the musician to control a much fuller range of sound. At the time, he says, “no serious composers were using real-time computer instruments for concert music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word spread at IRCAM that Machover’s opera was, to say the least, unusual. Over the course of December 1987, “VALIS” opened to packed houses in Paris, eliciting both cheers and groans of horror. “It was really controversial,” Machover says, “It really stirred people up. It was like, ‘Wow, we’ve never heard anything like this. It has melody and harmonies and driving rhythms in a way that new music isn’t supposed to.’” “VALIS” existed somewhere between an orchestra and a rock band, the purely acoustic dissolving into the electric as the opera progressed. In today’s era of the remix, audiences might be accustomed to a mélange of musical styles, but then this hybrid approach was new. Machover — who trained as a cellist in addition to playing bass in rock bands — has always borrowed freely from high and low, classical and rock, human and synthetic, acoustic and hi-tech, combining parts to create new wholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Dick’s philosophical novel is itself a study of fragments, of the divided self, as the main character, Phil, confronts his fictional double, Horselover Fat, while entering on a hallucinatory spiritual quest after the suicide of a friend. At the time of Dick’s writing, the term artificial intelligence had yet to achieve widespread use. And yet, in “VALIS,” he combines ideas about AI and mysticism to explore questions of existence. In Dick’s vision, “VALIS” was the grand unifying theory that connected a vast array of seemingly disparate ideas. “For him, that’s what God was: this complex technological system,” Machover says, “His big question was: Is it possible for technology to be the answer? Is it possible for anything to be the answer, or am I just lost? He was looking for what could possibly reconnect him to the world and reconnect the parts of his personality, and envisioned a technology to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A performance for the contemporary era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full production of “VALIS” hasn’t been mounted in over 30 years, but it’s a fitting moment to re-stage the opera as Dick’s original vision of the living artificial intelligence system&amp;nbsp;— as well as hopes for its promise and fears for its pitfalls — seems increasingly prophetic. The new performance was developed at MIT over the course of the last few years with funding from the MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology, among other sources. Performed at MIT Theater Building W97, the production stars baritone Davóne Tines and mezzo-soprano Anaïs Reno. Joining them also were vocalists Timur Bekbosunov, David Cushing, Maggie Finnegan, Rose Hegele, and Kristin Young, as well as pianist/keyboardist Julia Carey and multi-percussionist Maria Finkelmeier. New AI-enhanced technologies, created and performed by Max Addae, Emil Droga, Nina Masuelli, Manaswi Mishra, and Ana Schon, were developed in the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, which Machover directs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Machover collaborated with theater director Jay Scheib, Class of 1949 Professor of Music and Theater Arts, whose augmented reality theater productions have long probed the confused border between the simulacra and the real. “We took camera feeds of live action, process the signal and then project it back, like a strange film, on a variety of surfaces, both TV- and screen-like but also diaphonous and translucent,” says Scheib, “It’s lots and lots of images accumulating at a really high speed, and a mix of choreography and styles of film acting, operatic acting.” Against an innovative set designed by Oana Botez, lighting by Yuki Link, and media by Peter A. Torpey PhD ’13, actors played multiple characters as time splinters and refracts. “Reality is constantly shifting,” says Scheib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the opera sped toward the hallucinatory finale, becoming progressively disorienting, a computer music composer named Mini appeared, originally played by Machover, conjuring the angelic hologram Sophia who delivers Phil/Fat to a state of wholeness. In the opera’s libretto, Mini is described as “sculpting sound” instead of simply playing the keyboard, “setting off musical structures with the flick of his hand — he seemed to be playing the orchestra of the future.” Machover composed Mini’s section beforehand in the original production, but the contemporary performance used a custom-built AI model, fed with Machover’s own compositions, to create new music in real time. “It’s not an instrument, exactly. It’s a living system that gets explored during the performance,” says Machover, “It’s like a system that Mini might actually have built.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they were developing the project this past spring, the Opera of the Future group wrestled with the question: How would Mini “perform” the system? “Because this is live, this is real, we wanted it to feel fresh and new, and not just be someone waving hands in the air,” says Machover. One day, Nina Masuelli ’23, who had recently completed her undergraduate degree at MIT, brought a large clear plastic jar into the lab. The group experimented with applying sensors to the jar, and then connected it to the AI system. As Mini manipulates the jar, the machine’s music responds in turn. “It’s incredibly magical,” says Machover. “It’s this new kind of object that allows a living system to be explored and to form right in front of you. It’s different every time, and every time it makes me smile with delight as something unexpected is revealed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the performance neared, and Machover watched Masuelli continue to sculpt sound with the hollow jug, a string of Christmas lights coiled inside, something occurred to him: “Why don’t you be Mini?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, in the age of ChatGPT and DALL-E, Mini’s exchange with the AI system is symbolic of humanity’s larger dance with machine intelligence, as we experiment with ways to exist and create alongside it: an ongoing venture that will eventually be for the next generation to explore. Writing thousands of sprawling pages in what he called his “exegesis,” Philip K. Dick spent the rest of his life after his “pink light experience” trying to make sense of a universe “transformed by information.” Though the many questions raised by “VALIS” — Is technology the answer? — might never be fully explained, says Machover, “you can feel them through music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audiences apparently felt the same way. As &lt;a href="https://artsfuse.org/279661/opera-review-tod-machovers-valis-futuristic-sturm-und-drang/"&gt;one reviewer wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “'VALIS' is an operatic tour-de-force.” The three shows were filled to capacity, with long waiting lists, and response was wildly enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has been deeply gratifying to see that “VALIS” has captured the imagination of a new group of creative collaborators and astonishing performers, of brilliant student inventors and artists, and of the public, wonderfully diverse in age and background,” says Machover, “This is partially due to the visionary nature of Philip K. Dick’s novel (much of which is even more relevant today than when the book and opera first appeared). I hope it also reflects something of the musical vitality and richness of the score, which feels as fresh to me as when I composed it over 35 years ago. I am truly delighted that “VALIS” is back, and hope very much that it is here to stay!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world-famous Bayreuth Festival in Germany, annually centered around the works of composer Richard Wagner, launched this summer on July 25 with a production that has been making headlines. Director &lt;a href="https://www.jayscheib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Scheib&lt;/a&gt;, an MIT faculty member, has created a version of Wagner’s celebrated opera “&lt;a href="https://www.stage-plus.com/video/vod_concert_APNM8GRFDPHMASJKBSPJCE8" target="_blank"&gt;Parsifal&lt;/a&gt;” that is set in an apocalyptic future (rather than the original Medieval past), and uses augmented reality headset technology for a portion of the audience, among other visual effects. People using the headsets see hundreds of additional visuals, from fast-moving clouds to arrows being shot at them. The AR portion of the production was developed through a team led by designer and MIT Technical Instructor &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/joshua-higgason" target="_blank"&gt;Joshua Higgason&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “Parsifal” has engendered extensive media attention and discussion among opera followers and the viewing public. Five years in the making, it was developed with the encouragement of Bayreuth Festival general manager Katharina Wagner, Richard Wagner’s great-granddaughter. The production runs until Aug. 27, and can also be &lt;a href="https://www.stage-plus.com/video/vod_concert_APNM8GRFDPHMASJKBSPJCE8" target="_blank"&gt;streamed on Stage+&lt;/a&gt;. Scheib, the Class of 1949 Professor in MIT’s Music and Theater Arts program, recently talked to &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; about the project from Bayreuth. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Your production of “Parsifal” led off this year’s entire Bayreuth festival. How’s it going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; From my point of view it’s going quite swimmingly. The leading German opera critics and the audiences have been super-supportive and Bayreuth makes it possible for a work to evolve … Given the complexity of the technical challenge of making an AR project function in an opera house, the bar was so high, it was a difficult challenge, and we’re really happy we found a way forward, a way to make it work, and a way to make it fit into an artistic process. I feel great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You offer a new interpretation of “Parsifal,” and a new setting for it. What is it, and why did you choose to interpret it this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the main themes in “Parsifal” is that the long-time king of this holy grail cult is wounded, and his wound will not heal. [With that in mind], we looked at what the world was like when the opera premiered in the late 19th century, around the time of what was known as the Great African Scramble, when Europe re-drew the map of Africa, largely based on resources, including mineral resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt remains [the focus of] dirty mining practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and is a requirement for a lot of our electronic objects, in particular batteries. There are also these massive copper deposits discovered under a Buddhist temple in Afghanistan, and lithium under a sacred site in Nevada. We face an intense challenge in climate change, and the predictions are not good. Some of our solutions like electric cars require these materials, so they’re only solutions for some people, while others suffer [where minerals are being mined]. We started thinking about how wounds never heal, and when the prospect of creating a better world opens new wounds in other communities. … That became a theme. It also comes out of the time when we were making it, when Covid happened and George Floyd was murdered, which created an opportunity in the U.S. to start speaking very openly about wounds that have not healed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set it in a largely post-human environment, where we didn’t succeed, and everything has collapsed. In the third act, there’s derelict mining equipment, and the holy water is this energy-giving force, but in fact it’s this lithium-ion pool, which gives us energy and then poisons us. That’s the theme we created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What were your goals about integrating the AR technology into the opera, and how did you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; First, I was working with my collaborator Joshua Higgason. No one had ever really done this before, so we just started researching whether it was possible. And most of the people we talked to said, “Don’t do it. It’s just not going to work.” Having always been a daredevil at heart, I was like, “Oh, come on, we can figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were diligent in exploring the possibilities. We made multiple trips to Bayreuth and made these milimeter-accurate laser scans of the auditorium and the stage. We built a variety of models to see how to make AR work in a large environment, where 2,000 headsets could respond simultaneously. We built a team of animators and developers and programmers and designers, from Portugal to Cambridge to New York to Hungary, the UK, and a group in Germany. Josh led this team, and they got after it, but it took us the better part of two years to make it possible for an audience, some of whom don’t really use smartphones, to put on an AR headset and have it just work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even believe we did this. But it’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; In opera there’s hopefully a productive tension between tradition and innovation. How do you think about that when it comes to Wagner at Bayreuth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation is the tradition at Bayreuth. Musically and scenographically. “Parsifal” was composed for this particular opera house, and I’m incredibly respectful of what this event is made for. We are trying to create a balanced and unified experience, between the scenic design and the AR and the lighting and the costume design, and create perfect moments of convergence where you really lose yourself in the environment. I believe wholly in the production and the performers are extraordinary. Truly, truly, truly extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; People have been focused on the issue of bringing AR to Bayreuth, but what has Bayreuth brought to you as a director?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Working in Bayreuth has been an incredible experience. The level of intellectual integrity among the technicians is extraordinary. The amount of care and patience and curiosity and expertise in Bayreuth is off the charts. This community of artists is the greatest. … People come here because it’s an incredible meeting of the minds, and for that I’m immensely filled with gratitude every day I come into the rehearsal room. The conductor, Pablo Heras-Casado, and I have been working on this for several years. And the music is still first. We’re setting up technology not to overtake the music, but to support it, and visually amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be said that Katharina Wagner has been one of the most powerfully supportive artistic directors I have ever worked with. I find it inspiring to witness her tenacity and vision in seeing all of this through, despite the hurdles. It’s been a great collaboration. That’s the essence: great collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This work was supported, in part, by an &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mitnano-immersion-lab-gaming-program-awards-seed-grants-1117" target="_blank"&gt;MIT.nano Immersion Lab Gaming Program seed grant&lt;/a&gt;, and was developed using capabilities in the Immersion Lab. The project was also funded, in part, by a grant from the &lt;a href="http://arts.mit.edu/cast" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"&gt;MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Professor Keeril Makan has been named associate dean of the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS), effective July 1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agustín Rayo, the Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS, says Makan will serve concurrently as associate dean and in his current role as head of the MIT Music and Theater Arts (MTA) Section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Throughout my time as dean, I’ve been consistently impressed by Keeril’s leadership and insight as head of MTA. I look forward to working with him at the school level and relying on his advice,” Rayo says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makan says he’s looking forward to bringing his collaborative leadership approach to this new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that excites me about being head of MTA is working on larger projects that advance the mission of the unit, the mission of the Institute, and have a large impact on the community. This involves getting a lot of people together from different parts of MIT, working towards a common goal, skills that I’ve developed through my work as a composer. I look forward to working in this way at the SHASS-wide level, as well as finding common ground between SHASS and the STEM fields,” says Makan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makan joined the MIT faculty in 2006, and was named head of MTA in 2018. In addition to being section head, Makan is currently the Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the projects Makan has helped lead as section head has been the construction of MIT’s new music building, which is set to open in fall 2024. He’s also worked to develop MTA’s music technology offerings, including the upcoming launch of a new master’s program, joint with the School of Engineering.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makan says one of his biggest challenges was leading MTA through the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Performance was particularly challenging in music and theater. But we worked collaboratively to create an educational experience for the students that was artistically meaningful. The experience of Covid taught the world the power of being in a room together, sharing an experience” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rayo says Makan will lead special projects, and that they’ll work together over the summer to set an agenda for the new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After training as a violinist, Makan received degrees in composition and religion from Oberlin College and Conservatory and completed his PhD in composition at the University of California at Berkeley, with additional studies in Helsinki and Paris. He is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Luciano Berio Rome Prize from the American Academy in Rome, among other accolades. His music has been recorded by the Kronos Quartet, the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, and the International Contemporary Ensemble, and performed at the Los Angeles Opera, Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and Tanglewood.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Breaking down barriers in music research</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Associate Professor Leslie Tilley’s passion for a diversity of musical practices comes through in her research and in the classroom.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Michael Brindley | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ethnomusicologist and music analyst Leslie Tilley loves the idea of blurring genres and appreciating the beauty in all music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are engaging things to find in any style of music. I’m constantly surprised by what you can do with music, and that is my favorite thing: to continue being surprised,” says Tilley, an associate professor of music at MIT. “Music is endlessly creative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about her personal music tastes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the hardest question you can ask a musician,” says Tilley, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will listen to anything,” she says. “My alarm clock this morning was Dvorak’s Cello Concerto, and then I went for a walk listening to Bad Bunny. I nerd out listening to flamenco music, and then I talk to people about gamelan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straddling the borders of music research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilley’s own musical playlist is as expansive as the scope of her ethnographic research, which examines the inherent processes and unspoken guidelines governing improvisation. Through her research, Tilley is doing her part to break down barriers within the field. Tilley was recently awarded the prestigious Emerging Scholar Award by the Society for Music Theory for her book “&lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo44520596.html"&gt;Making It Up Together: The Art of Collective Improvisation in Balinese Music and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.” The honor is of particular note given that Tilley is not a music theorist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because I’m an ethnomusicologist who does music analysis, which is a smaller group of ethnomusicologists, I’ve always felt like I’m straddling the borders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why she says this particular award is so gratifying — not just for the recognition of her work, but because of what it says about the walls coming down within the world of music research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That music theory decided to give an award to an ethnomusicologist who’s studying Balinese music, and using lots of Balinese and Indonesian music and ideas, it says really cool things about what’s happening in the field and how the divisions are fading, or being broken down by lots of scholars, not just me,” she says. “There are lots of people straddling the borders of these different sub-fields.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilley’s book was published in 2019, and was the culmination of years of research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The book is about creating language so that people who study different improvised traditions can have a unified framework to talk about them, which didn’t exist before,” she adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilley says as she was writing the book, it took her in directions she didn’t expect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“​What I learned was just where all the intersections are if you zoomed the lens back a little bit more,” she says. “That there are all these amazing scholarly intersections where I know people who are writing about literature or people who are writing about the brain, and patterns. And all of these things can play into how I think about what musicians are doing. And that was really, really exciting for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching ‘music with a capital M’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since joining the MIT faculty in 2015, Tilley has been sharing her passion for a diversity of musical practices with students. She has led the MIT Balinese gamelan, and teaches courses such as 21M.030 (Introduction to Musics of the World), 21M.051 (Fundamentals of Tonal Music), 21M.500 (Advanced Seminar in Music), and 21M.292 (Musics in Bali). Tilley says she designed her course 21M.053 (Rhythms of the World) as a re-imagined fundamentals of music course that explores musical concepts as cross-cultural and cross-genre phenomena: a chance for students to learn about “music with a capital M.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One hundred percent of the people in the world engage with music in some way,” she says. “And so, (students) all come with their own expertise. In a class like Rhythms of the World, where there's not a specific tradition that I'm teaching them about, they can bring their expertise. They can bring their own life experience into that space, and then grow from there. And then engage with other people's life experiences in ways that are very personal within music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her favorite parts of teaching is when she asks students to analyze a piece of music they’re interested in using the concepts and structures they’ve learned in Rhythms of the World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re listening across the board to anything and everything you can imagine,” she says. “Every semester I discover some cool new thing I didn’t know before, or an interesting style of music just based on what my students are listening to.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring cover songs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilley’s current research project is a book examining cover songs. She says that while that may seem like a left turn, it’s actually an extension of the research she’s been doing her entire career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What I’m interested in is: How do people take a musical thing and do something with it, and how do we think about the transformation of that thing? How does a musician take something and transform it into something else? And how can we talk about that in useful and multifaceted ways?” she says. “Considering the music itself, considering the musicians who are making it, considering the idiom that it's coming from or going to. Considering who's receiving it and how it’s being received. And how does all that play into what that transformation means?”&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Combining digital technology with the human voice, Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT winner Pamela Z creates layered music from everyday life.<br>

        <dc:creator>Anya Ventura | Arts at MIT</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1980s, artist Pamela Z was working at Tower Records on Columbus Street in San Francisco, where one of her jobs was replacing pages in the store’s Phonolog, an enormous alphabetized directory of all the music available at the time, which formed a kind of bible of pop. When she ripped one loose-leafed sheet from the book, she noticed that all the titles on that sheet began with “you.” You stayed on my mind. You stole my heart. You stepped out of a dream.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;When spoken, the repetition of the words had an undulating, musical quality. It soon found its way into one of her electronic compositions, the found poetry processed with four-track cassette recorder, the simple list of phrases made incantatory through the looped rhythms of the human voice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pamela Z, the recipient of this year’s Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT, has become renowned for her pioneering work in live digital looping and interactive audio/video performance. Her voice is the centerpiece of these performances, manipulating and layering recordings in real time to produce complex sonic textures. Through the use of experimental extended vocal techniques, operatic bel canto, multimedia and sampled sounds, digital processing, and wireless MIDI controllers that use physical gestures to manipulate sound, Z creates immersive and magical aural collages.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While her first tool was a hollow-body guitar, which Z would use to accompany herself in clubs at night as she sang opera arias by day, her art changed once she discovered a digital delay in the '80s. “I came home from the music store, hooked everything up and started singing through it,” she remembers. “I never went to sleep that night because I was just looping my voice over and over again, and discovering beautiful properties of repetition, of layering, of being able to harmonize with myself, of being able to make complicated things by feeding back into the delay as I added more and more layers. I really think that I was never the same after that.” Having new technological tools, she said, allowed her to listen in new ways, discovering all the polyphonic dimensions within a single sound.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, Z has sought possibility in the objects of everyday life — Slinkies, plastic water jugs, hair clippers, and power tools — working these found materials into densely layered compositions, woven through with her classically trained soprano. The sound of the freight elevator in her loft, a glass falling on the floor, or a fragment of conversation can all become defamiliarized and creatively repurposed in the work. What begins as a simple act of noticing, then, in the process of composition, evolves into much larger meditations on the human condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2010 work “Baggage Allowance,” for example, the experience of hauling suitcases through airport security expanded into a philosophical investigation of memory, belonging, and what it means to carry things with you. “Her process is ‘Let's explore a subject area, or take these objects and put them together. Let's take this language and cut it up, letting its meaning evolve through examining it in what seems to be an objective way,'” says Evan Ziporyn, Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor of Music and faculty director of the Center for Art, Science and Technology, “and then ending up with something very subjective, personal, and moving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Z worked with students on their own compositions incorporating found sounds. The students, says Ziporyn, submitted their sounds two hours before the start of class. By the time the group met with Z, she had not only listened to each one but found in each something unique. What she modeled for the students, says Ziporyn, was a form of deep attention to a world swelling with sonic potential. “It was a good lesson in the idea of recontextualizing a sound that you find out in the world somewhere,” says Z, “And just by the act of recording it and listening to it on its own, you've already begun making a piece.” By the last session, she says, each student “had made really beautifully sculpted sound pieces.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z often performs her compositions with sensor-based, gesture-controlled MIDI instruments, wearing pieces of hardware as jewelry. Her gloved hands, like a conductor’s, summon sound from empty air. As part of her residency, Z performed a suite of her compositions for solo voice and electronics, ranging from early groundbreaking works to recently premiered ensemble pieces. Joining her, among musicians from the Boston area, were pianist Sarah Cahill, violinist Kate Stenberg, and flutist and MIT student Sara Simpson. Ziporyn conducted one of the pieces. For Z, the creation of the performance — its movements, feeling, and visuals — is deeply integrated into the process of composing itself. “It seems like magic — one voice becoming many, bird calls emerging and dispersing with the wave of a palm — but it’s really a multilayered virtuosity,” writes Ziporyn, “imbuing every aspect of Pamela’s work, smoothly masked by her grace as a performer. Pamela works with interactive music systems designer Donald Swearingen to develop the instruments and designs her own hardware, then learns how to use both as second nature.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some artworks fetishize the novelty of new technology, while others might dismiss it as somehow removed from what we perceive as human, Z has found a way to seamlessly combine digital tools with the ancient arts of performance, the manipulated sounds of the machine coalescing with the music of her own body.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Z’s expressive form of electronic music, Ziporyn says, reflects how we live today. It reflects the condition of living in a world mediated by technology, a world of bits and atoms, where the digital and analog are continually overlapping zones of experience. Her work, he says, defies any artificial separation between the so-called natural and the synthetic. And, as Z reminds us, we ourselves are electric: Everything we do, think, and feel is powered by the electrical currents coursing throughout the body. Her performances, says Ziporyn, are arguments for accepting that both the material and digital are part of what it means to think, feel, sense, and express — part of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented by the Council for the Arts at MIT, the Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT was first established by Margaret McDermott in honor of her husband, a legacy that is now carried on by their daughter Mary McDermott Cook. The Eugene McDermott Award plays a unique role at the Institute by bringing the MIT community together to support MIT’s principal arts organizations: the Department of Architecture; the Art, Culture and Technology program; the Center for Art, Science and Technology; the List Visual Arts Center; the MIT Museum; and the Music and Theater Arts Section.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/volunteer-committee-helps-mit-community-living-sustainably-0421"&gt;reuse and recycling&lt;/a&gt; to new &lt;a href="https://sustainabilitysummit.mit.edu/agenda"&gt;carbon markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; events during &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/earthmonth"&gt;Earth Month at MIT&lt;/a&gt; spanned an astonishing range of ideas and approaches to tackling the climate crisis. The &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/nucleus"&gt;MIT Climate Nucleus&lt;/a&gt; offered funding to departments and student organizations to develop programming that would showcase the countless initiatives underway to make a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are six&amp;nbsp;— just six of many&amp;nbsp;— ways the MIT community is making a difference on climate right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Exchanging knowledge with policymakers to meet local, regional, and global challenges &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating solutions begins with understanding the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking during the annual Earth Day Colloquium of the &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (MITEI) about the practical challenges of implementing wind-power projects, for instance, Massachusetts State Senator Michael J. Barrett offered a sobering assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The senate chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, Barrett reported that while the coast of Massachusetts provides a conducive site for offshore wind, economic forces have knocked a major offshore wind installation project off track. The combination of the pandemic and global geopolitical instability has led to such great supply chain disruptions and rising commodity costs that a project considered necessary for the state to meet its near-term climate goals now faces delays, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like others at MIT, MITEI researchers keep their work grounded in the real-world constraints and possibilities for decarbonization, engaging with policymakers and industry to understand the on-the-ground challenges to technological and &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/area/policy-economics/"&gt;policy-based solutions&lt;/a&gt; and highlight the opportunities for greatest impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Developing new ways to prevent, mitigate, and adapt to the effects of climate change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An estimated 20 percent of MIT faculty work on some aspect of the climate crisis, an enormous research effort distributed throughout the departments, labs, centers, and institutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a dozen such projects were on display at a poster session coordinated by the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/"&gt;Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab&lt;/a&gt; (J-WAFS), &lt;a href="https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/"&gt;Environmental Solutions Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (ESI), and MITEI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students and postdocs presented innovations including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a mathematical tool for &lt;a href="https://eesg.mit.edu/publication/paper-2023-advisory-tool-for-managing/"&gt;managing reliability in wind-power systems&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;3D observations to assess the performance of a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/imaging-membranes-oil-out-water-0610"&gt;liquid-infused filter for environmental pollutants&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;techniques using nuclear magnetic resonance to &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k3QSfnhGZ8KONWm7LZMdlp5DzBNcgrndW_3Yo1rMm3U/edit"&gt;monitor soil carbon levels at large scale&lt;/a&gt;, which may help to validate sustainable agricultural practices;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a design for an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1115/DETC2022-88328"&gt;energy-efficient and affordable irrigation system&lt;/a&gt; for farmers with limited resources; and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Preparing students to meet the challenges of a climate-changed world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faculty and staff from more than 30 institutions of higher education convened at the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/envisioning-education-climate-changed-world-0501"&gt;MIT Symposium on Advancing Climate Education&lt;/a&gt; to exchange best practices and innovations in teaching and learning. Speakers and participants considered paths to structural change in higher education, the imperative to place equity and justice at the center of new educational approaches, and what it means to “&lt;a href="https://chancellor.mit.edu/whole-student"&gt;educate the whole student&lt;/a&gt;” so that graduates are prepared to live and thrive in a world marked by global environmental and economic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in April, MIT faculty voted to approve the creation of a new joint degree program in &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/3-questions-new-mit-major-and-its-role-fighting-climate-change-0420"&gt;climate system science and engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Offering climate curricula to K-12 teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a daylong conference on climate education for K-12 schools, the attendees were not just science teachers. Close to 50 teachers of arts, literature, history, math, mental health, English language, world languages, and even carpentry were all hungry for materials and approaches to integrate into their curricula. They were joined by another 50 high school students, ready to test out the workshops and content developed by &lt;a href="https://ceepr.mit.edu/cate/"&gt;MIT Climate Action Through Education&lt;/a&gt; (CATE), which are already being piloted in at least a dozen schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CATE initiative is led by Christopher Knittel, the George P. Shultz Professor of Energy Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management, deputy director for policy at MITEI, and faculty director of the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. The K-12 Climate Action and Education Conference was hosted as a collaboration with the Massachusetts Teachers Association Climate Action Network and Earth Day Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will be honest about the threats posed by climate change, but also give students a sense of agency that they can do something about this,” Knittel told &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/news/new-multidisciplinary-climate-change-curriculum-for-high-schools-aims-to-engage-and-mobilize-teachers-and-students/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MITEI Energy Futures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this spring. “And for the many teachers — especially non-science teachers — starved for knowledge and background material, CATE offers resources to give them confidence to implement our curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Guiding our communities in making sense of the coming changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arts and humanities, vital in their own right, are also central to the sharing of scientific knowledge and its integration into culture, behavior, and decision-making. A message well-delivered can reach new audiences and prompt reflection and reckoning on ethics and values, identity, and optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://climatemachine.mit.edu/"&gt;Climate Machine&lt;/a&gt;, part of ESI’s Arts and Climate program, produced an evening art installation on campus featuring dynamic, large-scale projections onto the façade of MIT’s new music building and a musical performance by electronic duo Warung. Passers-by were invited to take a &lt;a href="http://climatemachine.mit.edu/survey"&gt;Climate Identity Quiz&lt;/a&gt;, with the responses reflected in the visuals. Another exhibit displayed the results of a workshop in which attendees had used an artificial intelligence art tool to imagine the future of their hometowns, while another highlighted native Massachusetts wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Climate Machine is an MIT research project undertaken in collaboration with record label Anjunabeats. The collaborative team imagines interactive experiences centered on sustainability that could be &lt;a href="https://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/news/designing-a-sustainability-experience-for-music-festivals/"&gt;deployed at musical events and festivals&lt;/a&gt; to inspire climate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Empowering students to seize this unique policy moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESI’s &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/tilclimate-podcast"&gt;TILclimate Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which breaks down important climate topics for general listeners, held a live taping at the MIT Museum and offered an explainer on three recent, major pieces of federal legislation: the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill of 2021, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of funding and financial incentives for energy- and climate-related projects, along with reinvestment in industrial infrastructure, create “a real moment and an opportunity,” said special guest Elisabeth Reynolds, speaking with host Laur Hesse Fisher. Reynolds was a member of the National Economic Council from 2021 to 2022, serving as special assistant to the president for manufacturing and economic development; after leaving the White House, Reynolds returned to MIT, where she is a lecturer in MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For students, the opportunities to engage have never been better, Reynolds urged: “There is so much need. … Find a way to contribute, and find a way to help us make this transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re embarking on now, you just can’t overstate the significance of it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on how MIT is advancing climate action across education; research and innovation; policy; economic, social, and environmental justice; public and global engagement; sustainable campus operations; and more, visit &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/climateaction/fastforward"&gt;Fast Forward: MIT’s Climate Action Plan for the Decade&lt;/a&gt;. The actions described in the plan aim to accelerate the global transition to net-zero carbon emissions, and to “educate and empower the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A three-year recipient of &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study"&gt;MIT’s Emerson Classical Vocal Scholarships&lt;/a&gt;, senior Ananya Gurumurthy recalls getting ready to step onto the Carnegie Hall stage to sing a Mozart opera that she once sang with the New York All-State Choir. The choir conductor reminded her to articulate her words and to engage her diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t project your voice, how are people going to hear you when you perform?” Gurumurthy recalls her conductor telling her. “This is your moment, your chance to connect with such a tremendous audience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gurumurthy reflects on the universal truth of those words as she adds her musical talents to her math and computer science studies to campaign for social and economic justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The daughter of immigrants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Edgemont, New York, she was inspired to fight on behalf of others by her South Asian immigrant parents, who came to the United States in the 1980s. Her father is a management consultant and her mother has experience as an investment banker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They came barely 15 years after the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which removed national origin quotas from the American immigration system,” she says. “I would not be here if it had not been for the Civil Rights Movement, which preceded both me and my parents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her parents told her about their new home’s anti-immigrant sentiments; for example, her father was a graduate student in Dallas exiting a store when he was pelted with glass bottles and racial slurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I often consider the amount of bravery that it must have taken them to abandon everything they knew to immigrate to a new, but still imperfect, country in search of something better,” she says. “As a result, I have always felt so grounded in my identity both as a South Asian American and a woman of color. These identities have allowed me to think critically about how I can most effectively reform the institutions surrounding me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gurumurthy has been singing since she was 11, but in high school, she decided to also build her political voice by working for New York Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins. At one point, Gurumurthy noted a log was kept for the subjects of constituent calls, such as “affordable housing” and &amp;nbsp;“infrastructure,” and it was then that she became aware that Stewart-Cousins would address the most pressing of these callers’ issues before the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This experience was my first time witnessing how powerful the mobilization of constituents in vast numbers was for influencing meaningful legislative change,” says Gurumurthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After she began applying her math skills to political campaigns, Gurumurthy was soon tapped to run analytics for the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) midterm election initiative. As a lead analyst for the New York DNC, she adapted an interactive activation-competition (IAC) model to understand voting patterns in the 2018 and 2020 elections. She collected data from public voting records to predict how constituents would cast their ballots and used an IAC algorithm to strategize alongside grassroots organizations and allocate resources to empower historically disenfranchised groups in municipal, state, and federal elections to encourage them to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and student organizing at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she arrived at MIT in 2019 to study mathematics with computer science, along with minors in music and economics, she admits she was saddled with the naïve notion that she would “build digital tools that could single-handedly alleviate all of the collective pressures of systemic injustice in this country.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, she has learned to create what she calls “a more nuanced view.” She picked up data analytics skills to build mobilization platforms for organizations that pursued social and economic justice, including working in Fulton County, Georgia, with Fair Fight Action (through the Kelly-Douglas Fund Scholarship) to analyze patterns of voter suppression, and MIT’s ethics laboratories in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to build symbolic artificial intelligence protocols to better understand bias in artificial intelligence algorithms. For her work on the International Monetary Fund (through the &lt;a href="http://summerwash.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Washington Summer Internship Program&lt;/a&gt;), Gurumurthy was awarded second place for the 2022 &lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/publications/ilona-karmel-writing-prizes/winners/"&gt;S. Klein Prize in Technical Writing&lt;/a&gt; for her paper “The Rapid Rise of Cryptocurrency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The outcomes of each project gave me more hope to begin the next because I could see the impact of these digital tools,” she says. “I saw people feel empowered to use their voices whether it was voting for the first time, protesting exploitative global monetary policy, or fighting gender discrimination. I’ve been really fortunate to see the power of mathematical analysis firsthand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have come to realize that the constructive use of technology could be a powerful voice of resistance against injustice,” she says. “Because numbers matter, and when people bear witness to them, they are pushed to take action in meaningful ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoping to make a difference in her own community, she joined several Institute committees. As co-chair of the Undergraduate Association’s education committee, she propelled MIT’s first-ever digital petition for grade transparency and worked with faculty members on Institute committees to ensure that all students were being provided adequate resources to participate in online education in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The digital petition inspired her to begin a project, called Insite, to develop a more centralized digital means of data collection on student life at MIT to better inform policies made by its governing bodies. As Ring Committee chair, she ensured that the special traditions of the “Brass Rat” were made economically accessible to all class members by helping the committee nearly triple its financial aid budget. For her efforts at MIT, last May she received the &lt;a href="https://awards.mit.edu/awards/william-l-stewart-jr-award"&gt;William L. Stewart, Jr. Award&lt;/a&gt; for “[her] contributions [as] an individual student at MIT to extracurricular activities and student life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ananya plans on going to law school after graduation, to study constitutional law so that she can use her technical background to build quantitative evidence in cases pertaining to voting rights, social welfare, and ethical technology, and set legal standards ”for the humane use of data,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In building digital tools for a variety of social and economic justice organizations, I hope that we can challenge our existing systems of power and realize the progress we so&amp;nbsp;dearly need to witness. There is strength in numbers, both algorithmically and organizationally. I believe it is our responsibility to simultaneously use these strengths to&amp;nbsp;change the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her ambitions, however, began when she began singing lessons when she was 11; without her background as a vocalist, she says she would be voiceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Operatic performance has given me the ability&amp;nbsp;to truly step into my character and convey powerful emotions in my performance.&amp;nbsp;In the process, I have realized that my voice is most powerful when it reflects my true convictions, whether I am performing or publicly speaking. I truly believe that this honesty has allowed me to become an effective community organizer.&amp;nbsp;I’d like to believe that this voice is what compels those around me to act.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private musical study is available for students through the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/emersonharris-program-private-study#Scholarship%20Program"&gt;Emerson/Harris Program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers merit-based financial awards to students of outstanding achievement on their instruments or voice in classical, jazz, or world music.&amp;nbsp;The Emerson/Harris Program is funded by the late Cherry L. Emerson Jr. SM ’41, in response to an appeal from Associate Provost Ellen T. Harris (Class of 1949 professor emeritus of music).&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Over 300 social impact leaders from around the world convened on MIT’s campus to discuss global challenges and how to solve them together.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 16:50:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/solve-at-mit-collaboration-climate-efforts-forefront-social-impact-0515</guid>
        <dc:creator>MIT Solve</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“The scale, complexity, the global nature of the problems we’re dealing with are so big that no single institution, industry, or country can deal with them alone,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated in her first remarks to the Solve community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 300 social impact leaders from around the world convened on MIT’s campus for Solve at MIT 2023 to celebrate the 2022 Solver class and to discuss some of the world’s greatest challenges and how we can tackle them with innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges can be complicated and may even feel insurmountable, but Solve at MIT leaves us with the hope, tools, and connections needed to find solutions together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hala Hanna, executive director of MIT Solve, shared what keeps her inspired and at the front line of social impact: “Optimism isn’t about looking away from the issues but looking right at them, believing we can create the solutions and putting in the work. So, anytime I need a dose of optimism, I look to the innovators we work with,” Hanna shared during the opening plenary, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/qtIhBGrrvQ8?feature=share&amp;amp;t=1224"&gt;Unlocking our Collective Potential&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three days, more than 300 individuals from around the world convened to celebrate the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mit-solve-selects-new-class-of-40-tech-based-social-entrepreneurs-addressing-global-challenges-with-over-2-million-in-funding-301626129.html"&gt;2022 Solver class&lt;/a&gt;, create partnerships that lead to progress, and address solutions to pressing world issues in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every technologist, philanthropist, investor, and innovator present at Solve at MIT left with their own takeaway, but three main themes seemed to underscore the overall discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology and innovation are as neutral as the makers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having bias is a natural part of what makes us human. However, being aware of our predispositions is necessary to transform our lived experiences into actionable solutions for others to benefit from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve largely learned that bias can be both unavoidable and applied almost instantly. Sangbae Kim, director of the Biomimetic Robotics Laboratory and professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, proved this through robotics demonstrations where attendees almost unanimously were more impressed with a back-flipping MIT robot compared to one walking in circles. As it turns out, it took one individual three days to program a robot to do a flip and over two weeks for a full team to program one to walk. “We judge through the knowledge and bias we have based on our lived experiences,” Kim pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bias and lived experiences don’t have to be bad things. The solutions we create based on our own lives are what matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 Solver Atif Javed, co-founder and executive director of &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/equitable-health-systems/solutions/61417"&gt;Tarjimly&lt;/a&gt;, began translating for his grandmother as a child and learned about the struggles that come with being a refugee. This led him to develop &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/articles/half-of-all-refugees-and-immigrants-need-interpreters-now-they-have-tarjimly"&gt;a humanitarian language-translation application&lt;/a&gt;, which connects volunteer translators with immigrants, refugees, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and more, on demand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Castañeda Gill, 2022 Solver and co-founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/re-engage-learners/solutions/60685"&gt;Social Cipher&lt;/a&gt;, transformed her personal experience with ADHD and autism to develop Ava, &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/articles/video-games-a-safe-space-for-neurodiverse-youth-and-ojibwe-language-learners"&gt;a video game empowering neuro-divergent youth&lt;/a&gt; and facilitating social-emotional learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Kelsey Wirth, co-founder and chair of Mothers Out Front, the experience of motherhood and the shared concerns for the well-being of children are what unite her with other moms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitney Wolf Herd, founder and CEO of Bumble, shared that as a leader in technology and a person who witnessed toxic online spaces, she sees it as her responsibility to spearhead change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the plenary, “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/qxB9SgJVrjQ?feature=share&amp;amp;t=2233"&gt;Bringing us Together or Tearing us Apart?&lt;/a&gt;” Wolf Herd asked, “What if we could use technology to be a force for positivity?” She shared her vision for equality and respect to be part of the next digital wave. She also called for technology leaders to join her to ensure “guardrails and ground rules” are in place to make sure this goal becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social innovation must be intersectional and intergenerational&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Solve at MIT, industry leaders across sectors, cultures, ages, and expertise banded together to address pressing issues and to form relationships with innovators looking for support in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Bly, founder and CEO of System Inc., discussed the interconnected nature of all things and why his organization is on a mission to show the links, “We’re seeing rising complexity in the systems that make up life on earth, and it impacts us individually and globally. The way we organize the information and data we need to make decisions about those systems [is highly] siloed and highly fragmented, and it impairs our ability to make decisions in the most systemic, holistic, rational way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council Manish Bapna shared his advocacy for cross-sector work: “Part of what I’ve seen really proliferate and expand in a good way over the past 10 to 15 years are collaborations involving startups in the private sector, governments, and NGOs. No single stakeholder or organization can solve the problem, but by coming together, they bring different perspectives and skills in ways that can create the innovation we need to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) were seen as the subjects that would resolve our complex issues, but as it turns out, art also holds a tremendous amount of power to transcend identity, borders, status, and concerns, to connect us all and aid us in global unity. Artists Beatie Wolfe, Norhan Bayomi, Aida Murad, and Nneka Jones showed us how to bring healing and awareness to topics like social and environmental injustice through their music, embroidery, and painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/articles/mit-solve-announces-the-2023-solv-ed-innovators"&gt;2023 Solv[ED] Innovators&lt;/a&gt;, all age 24 or under, have solutions that are improving communication for individuals with hearing loss, transforming plastic waste into sustainable furniture, and protecting the Black birthing community, among other incredible feats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kami Dar, co-founder and CEO of Uniti Networks, summarizes the value of interconnected problem-solving: “My favorite SDG [sustainable development goal] is SDG number 17— the power of partnership. Look for the adjacent problem-solvers and make sure we are not reinventing the wheel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships and the environment connect us all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solve is working to address global challenges on an ongoing basis connected to climate, economic prosperity, health, and learning. Many of these focus areas bleed into one another, but social justice and climate action served as a backdrop for many global issues addressed during Solve at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we started addressing climate change, we saw it primarily as technical issues to bring down emissions … There's inequality, there’s poverty, there are social tensions that are rising … We are not going to address climate change without addressing the social tensions that are embedded,” said Lewis Akenji, managing director of the Hot or Cool Institute. Akenji sees food, mobility, and housing as the most impactful areas to focus solutions on first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w15dFwHPtw8?feature=share&amp;amp;t=555"&gt;Ensuring a Just Transition to Net Zero&lt;/a&gt;” plenary, Heather Clancy, vice president and editorial director at Greenbiz, asked panelists what lessons they have learned from their work. Janelle Knox Hayes, ​​professor of economic geography and planning at MIT, shared that listening to communities, especially front-line and Indigenous communities, is needed before deploying solutions to the energy crisis. “Climate work has this sense of urgency, like it rapidly has to be done … to do really engaged environmental justice work, we have to slow down and realize even before we begin, we need a long period of time to plan. But before we even do that, we have to rebuild relationships and trust and reciprocity … [This] will lead to better and longer-lasting solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hina Baloch, executive director and global head of climate change and sustainability strategy and communication at General Motors, asked Chéri Smith, founder of &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/indigenous-communities-2022/solutions/63126"&gt;Indigenous Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, to share her perspective on energy sovereignty as it relates to Indigenous communities. Smith shared, “Tribes can’t be sovereign if they’re relying on outside sources for their energy. We were founded to support the self-determination of tribes to revamp their energy systems and rebuild, construct, and maintain them themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith shared an example of human and tribal-centered innovation in the making. Through the Biden administration's national electronic vehicle (EV) initiative, Indigenous Energy Initiative and Native Sun Community Power Development will collaborate and create an inter-tribal EV charging network. “The last time we built out an electric grid, it deliberately skipped over tribal country. This time, we want to make sure that we not only have a seat at the table, but that we build out the tables and invite everyone to them,” said Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solve at MIT led to meaningful discussions about climate change, intersectional and accessible innovation, and the power that human connection has to unite everyone. Entrepreneurship and social change are the paths forward. And although the challenges ahead of us can be daunting, with community, collaboration, and a healthy dose of bravery, global challenges will continue to be solved by agile impact entrepreneurs all around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Adrianne Haslet, a professional ballroom dancer and Boston Marathon bombing survivor, reminded attendees, “What will get you to the finish line is nothing compared to what got you to the start line.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Big ideas took the stage on Monday morning, ahead of the inauguration of MIT’s 18th president, Sally Kornbluth. As final preparations were underway on Killian Court for the afternoon’s ceremonies, members of the MIT community gathered to welcome Kornbluth with an academic symposium exploring the theme “Where Big Ideas Come From — and Why They Matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Held at MIT’s Samberg Conference Center and streamed online, the symposium featured eight MIT faculty members representing a range of disciplines across the Institute. They took turns presenting their research and sharing their perspectives on how MIT can cultivate ideas and innovations to meet the major challenges of the world today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s wonderful to see you all at the start of quite an exciting day,” Kornbluth said, greeting the audience. “MIT has a bit more than 1,000 faculty members spread across dozens of fields. So you can consider the brilliant speakers today as a sort of tasting menu to whet your appetite to the rich intellectual environment of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was convened by Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, who kicked off the symposium by enthusiastically welcoming Kornbluth to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been inspired by your seemingly unbounded curiosity and passion for learning,” Chandrakasan said. “These two qualities that we find so important in our students, we find reflected in you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chandrakasan went on to emphasize the need for curiosity and collaboration across multiple fields in tackling the world’s most pressing problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As our global challenges become increasingly urgent, now more than ever we are in need of big ideas, which our faculty, students, staff, and alumni are working hard to generate,” he continued. “Problems like climate change simply cannot be solved unless researchers from nearly every discipline collaborate. Today we’ll hear of ideas that span disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/crb@mit.edu"&gt;Cullen Buie&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of mechanical engineering, was the first speaker to take the stage. In opening his talk, Buie marveled at the progress of gene therapy, pointing out that the technology has advanced in recent years such that some patients’ own cells can be genetically altered to eradicate diseases such as sickle cell disease and certain types of leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These amazing technologies are ushering in a new frontier,” Buie said. “But many patients will not receive these therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason, he found, was that it simply takes too long to make these therapies. And the major bottleneck stems from one specific step in the manufacturing process: the delivery of genetic material into a patient’s cells. In learning about the different ways in which researchers are attempting to streamline gene therapy, Buie came across a company that was close to automating the entire manufacturing process, save for the crucial step of gene delivery, which involved painstaking, highly individualized labwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This company had created a sports car for cell engineering, but it was limited to second gear because the gene delivery was too slow,” Buie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization kicked off an idea: What if genes could be delivered in a faster, continuously flowing fashion? The idea sparked Kytopen, a startup co-founded by Buie and former MIT postdoc and research scientist Paolo Garcia, who developed a new technology to quickly and continuously deliver genetical material into human cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technology, he says, is “poised to revolutionize the field.” And closer to home, the idea would help patients like Buie’s own son, who has sickle cell disease and has experienced the excruciating “pain crises” that the condition brings on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Kytopen, and the technologies that Buie and his colleagues are developing, he hopes to have a solution for his son and others who suffer from genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These big ideas come from you, from me, from anyone who sees someone like my son suffering, and they decide they want to do something about it,” Buie said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As innovations are made in medicine, there will also need to be innovations in how we finance them — a point that was made by &lt;a href="https://alo.mit.edu/biography/"&gt;Andrew Lo&lt;/a&gt;, the Charles E. and Susan T. Harris Professor of Finance, who followed Buie’s talk. He began by echoing Buie’s excitement for new gene therapies that target and correct “typos” in DNA. These therapies have been proven to cure certain rare diseases, and are on the verge of success with more common diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a really big deal,” Lo said. “The problem is, these cures don’t come cheap. There are eye-popping numbers that come with these therapies. They’re hitting health care budgets really hard. Can we afford them?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo believes that we can, with a new, subscription-based model that he likens to Netflix for health care. He envisions a company’s health plan could pay a subscription fee directly to various drug manufacturers, such as Novartis, and these drug manufacturers in turn would administer therapies to patients with zero to little additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A Netflix model could offer a menu of therapies and could give more access to therapies,” Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and a colleague, Yutong Sun, have founded a company, Quantile Health, to develop and test such a subscription-based health plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Finance doesn’t always have to be a zero-sum game,” Lo said. “With the right kind of financing, scale, and business model, we can do well by doing good. And we can do it now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A longstanding investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://orgchart.mit.edu/leadership/associate-provost-and-associate-vice-president-research-administration/biography#tabbiography"&gt;Anne White&lt;/a&gt;, associate provost and associate vice president for research administration, spoke next, about the promise of fusion technology in providing electricity at a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you could harness the energy released from fusion reactions from deuterium and tritium, you could power a city the size of Boston with a pickup truck of fuel,” White said. “No greenhouse emissions, minimal waste, little land usage, small environmental impact. This is the huge promise of fusion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That promise, White said, is closer to realization than ever, thanks to a convergence of four essential pieces: community consensus and mature science, policy and public private partnership, private funding, and longstanding university leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT, she pointed out, has been significantly involved this endeavor, in part through the continued work of researchers in the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, the development of a new superconducting magnet technology to enable smaller, faster fusion devices, and various MIT startups focused on advancing key steps of fusion technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The fusion ecosystem is flourishing,” White said. “We could be 15 years away from a demonstration of electricity from fusion — a very clean, very safe, nearly unlimited source of low-carbon energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Big ideas don’t come out of thin air,” she concluded. “They come from longstanding investment in people and their ideas that might just change the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting for carbon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobility.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao"&gt;Jinhua Zhao&lt;/a&gt; is looking to decarbonize transportation by changing the way we behave. Zhao, who is the Edward and Joyce Linde Associate Professor of City and Transportation Planning, is also the founder and director of the MIT Mobility Initiative, where he brings together work across the Institute on transportation research, education, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhao opened his talk with a picture of Beijing traffic today — an image that he pointed out is not too different from Boston gridlock. As a counterpart, he showed the same region of Beijing, 40 years ago, its streets filled with pedestrians, bicyclists, and electric trolleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We call this sustainable, low-carbon, active traffic — all this beautiful vocabulary,” Zhao said. “In the past 40 years, we have moved away from this paradigm” in favor of a gasoline-based infrastructure. Now, in order to move away from a gasoline economy, he says electrification is key. But so is a change in our own behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What did you have for dinner last night? How much did that cost you? How much time did it take you? How much carbon did that meal cost?” Zhao said. “Most of us would have no clue. We wouldn’t even have the order of magnitude right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We want to establish money, time, and carbon as fundamental units of societal accounting,” said Zhao, who has set up a company, Tram Global, that establishes a digital marketplace that aims to reward those who take certain actions to reduce their daily carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To change individual behavior is hard,” said Zhao. “Norms are sticky, and take about a generation to change. But maybe we can accelerate that process just enough to save our planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A musical pivot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/eran-egozy"&gt;Eran Egozy&lt;/a&gt;, professor of the practice in music technology, was next to speak, participating via video. The co-founder of the videogame developer Harmonix took the symposium audience through the early days of the company and the development of its most popular game, “Guitar Hero,” which aimed to let every player experience the joy of making music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egozy, who is himself a clarinetist, remembers the painful early days of learning the instrument — an experience that defeats many beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you can overcome this chasm, and get to the point where you derive real pleasure from playing your instrument, you can launch yourself into this beautiful world of music making,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this vision ultimately led to a very successful product in “Guitar Hero,” Egozy said the team developed 10 games along the way that were commercial failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But we learned from our mistakes, pivoted and adjusted, lived another day, and made another product or game that was a little better than the previous one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Guitar Hero” has since inspired many to take up actual instruments, including the rapper and singer/songwriter Post Malone and composer and guitarist Yasmin Williams. Ergozy closed his talk by playing a video of Williams playing, in a twist of “karmic awesomeness,” a cover of Post Malone’s “Sunflower.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new twist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://physics.mit.edu/faculty/pablo-jarillo-herrero/"&gt;Pablo Jarillo-Herrero&lt;/a&gt;, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics, next introduced the attendees to quantum matter and the study of multiple interacting particles at the quantum scale. He pointed out that the behavior of a single particle such as an electron is well-understood. But when part of a cloud of many interacting particles, electrons collectively demonstrate entirely new and unknown behaviors that can result in “fascinating states of matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jarillo-Herrero and his colleagues have discovered many new quantum states of matter that can arise when two layers of carbon atoms, or sheets of graphene, are placed atop each other and twisted just slightly. At certain angles, the particles within the sheets can take on unexpected, exotic properties, such as superconductivity, that were not possible with each sheet separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With this new platform, we have realized all of the phases of quantum matter known in nature, and a few new ones,” Jarillo-Herrero said. “We don’t understand why this happens, but there’s hope that if we can, we can design new technologies, such as better magnets for fusion technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A radio world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/dina-katabi"&gt;Dina Katabi&lt;/a&gt;, the Thuan and Nicole Pham Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, is harnessing the behavior of radio signals to continuously and noninvasively read a patient’s health status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hook patients up to electrodes and monitors to track their heartbeats, brain activity, and breathing, she says that wireless devices that emit radio signals could be sensitive enough to track a patient’s vitals. Her group has developed devices that they are currently using to collect data from patients with Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, and Covid-19, and are using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to decipher meaningful patterns in the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Parkinson’s in particular, they are hoping the radio-based monitoring could help to diagnose the disease much earlier in its progression. For most patients, a diagnosis comes only after motor symptoms such as tremors and stiffness become apparent. But, Katabi noted, even James Parkinson, who was first to describe the disease’s symptoms, noticed changes in breathing early on in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katabi wondered: Could Parkinson’s be diagnosed much earlier through changes in a patient’s breathing? She and her colleagues are gathering data from patients, and developing AI methods to pick up on meaningful patterns in breathing that could enable an early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We envision this being in every home, like smoke detectors,” says Katabi, who proposed that devices could be programmed to check for signs of various diseases, conditions, and behaviors. “We could write applications to check on Grandma if she’s taking her medications,” she offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative invention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ki.mit.edu/people/faculty/sangeeta-bhatia"&gt;Sangeeta Bhatia&lt;/a&gt;, the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, emphasized the importance of “convergence” in cultivating new inventions. Her group combines the fields of nanotechnology and medicine to develop new therapies for patients with cancer by harnessing the unique properties of materials at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just as these materials have unique physical properties at nanoscale, they also have unique biological properties,” Bhatia said. “How they traffic inside the body changes with their size. So, you can design materials that speak the language of biology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To her point, Bhatia’s group has recently developed an ultrasensitive sensor in the form of particles that are each 1/1,000 the width of a human hair and that can travel through a patient’s bloodstream and detect the presence of cancer. The particles are small enough to pass through the kidney and out of the body, making the sensor “completely noninvasive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team set up a company, Glympse Bio, to advance the technology, and has explored a variety of methods to deliver the sensors, including as a urine test akin to a pregnancy test, and an oral test similar to a breathalyzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Invention is an iterative process,” Bhatia said. “I imagine it’s like writing a song. You start in one direction and make it up as you go. Invention begets invention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symposium closed out with a roundtable discussion moderated by Boston Globe Media CEO Linda Pizzuti Henry SM ’05, who asked the group to offer advice for Kornbluth as she takes on the MIT presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Climate change is a big one,” White said. “We will have to pull from every discipline, every department, will have to inspire people through art and music to think about the planet, and combine life sciences with computing to connect back to the climate in inventive ways that we haven’t even thought of. So, keep the imagination going in thinking about climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for our future that we are more inclusive than we have been historically,” Bhatia added. She noted that there there are 130 startups with roots at the Koch Institute, but she and her colleagues found there could have been 40 more because women at MIT were underfounding companies in the life sciences. “If we are really going to meet the future, we have to make sure we get all the minds at the table.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Jarillo-Herrero, support of basic research was foremost, notably for research in quantum science, which could ultimately impact everything from computing to environmental sensing to health care monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you start exploring things you don’t understand, something could happen that could change the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Think big,” Lo added. “Because we are now at an inflection point in society in dealing with difficult challenges, and if we don’t deal with it successfully, there won’t be future generations. I think MIT is the perfect place, we are poised to have that impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | Kathy Wren | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s campus spilled over with good cheer yesterday during a community-wide celebration marking the upcoming inauguration of MIT President Sally Kornbluth on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a day of activities that truly had something for everyone, MIT community members and their families enjoyed an array of student performances, amusement park rides, exhibits hosted by MIT’s departments and labs, and plenty of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a historic moment — a lot of change could happen from here forward,” senior Anjali Sinha said. “We’re welcoming a new person into the community, so it’s really a joyous occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family-friendly event primarily took place in Killian Court, Hockfield Court, and the buildings in between — though people could be seen sporting balloon hats and enjoying sweets in nearly every building on campus.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Thousands of people braved the (mostly wrong) rain forecast to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s really cool to see everybody come out and celebrate together, as well as getting to see all of the different student groups showcase their talents and what they’ve been working hard on,” senior Anjali Singh said. “There’s just a lot of energy, and having events like this helps balance out the work we do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underneath a football field-sized tent on Killian Court, community members took in dance and musical performances from student groups and tried their hands at minigolf, mandala sand art, and cornhole. Kids led their parents around a jungle gym of inflatable tubes, fluorescent swings, and seesaws. People perused the food stands lining the perimeter of the tent and came together at large tables in the center of the action. Music and the scent of popcorn radiated out of the tent from all sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love how it’s bringing the community together, not just MIT, but I think there’s a lot of locals here as well,” Darsh Grewal, a junior, said. “There’s a lot to do, a lot of free food — which is always great for the students. It’s really showcasing how diverse MIT is, which is great as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hockfield Court also featured a stage with student performances and activities that came across as half carnival, half research fair. Community members hopped from an arcade area to pinwheel-making stations and T shirt giveaways. People got massages next to biomaker demonstrations. Real dogs sniffed curiously at a mini robotic cheetah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the tent, Hockfield Court was all carnival. Lined by food trucks serving up street corn, ice cream, and cupcakes, the area offered amusement park rides and face painting stations. Acrobatic performers and a woman on stilts moved effortlessly across the lawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hallways and buildings between the courts also featured clues of the fun outside, with people double-fisting baked goods and the sounds and smells of the tents lingering. Travelers stopped at demonstrations by MIT’s Glass Lab and explored an exhibit in MIT’s Compton Gallery, which showcased student projects. A third stage in Lobby 13 played Caribbean music and a fourth in Lobby 10 played a sampling of musical styles. For once the &lt;a href="http://ua.mit.edu/innovation"&gt;Banana Lounge&lt;/a&gt; was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all of the activities, community members conveyed a sense of excitement for Kornbluth’s arrival at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Especially after Covid, a day like this is very important,” Research Affiliate Seth Riskin said. “I’m pleased to see so many people come out. People want to connect, and it’s a nice occasion for that. An inauguration is a time of promise, vision, and future, and we all wanted to celebrate that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, a free concert in Kresge Auditorium showcased the talent and creativity of the roughly 100 performers who make up the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble, the MIT Wind Ensemble, and the MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble. Titled “&lt;a href="http://inauguration.mit.edu/we-are-the-forest"&gt;We Are the Forest: Music of Resilience and Activism&lt;/a&gt;,” and featuring the three student ensembles plus several MIT faculty and visiting artists, the event delivered a “sonic awakening” about the plight of the Amazon and urgency of the global climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the pieces were developed as part of cultural exchanges between the MIT musicians and local communities in Puerto Rico and Brazil. In a rousing performance that ended with musicians and audience members stomping their feet with the music, saxophonist Miguel Zenón and the MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble reprised “En Pie De Lucha,” composed by Zenón in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in Puerto Rico. The group also performed the piece during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vptYlSHEoAg&amp;amp;t=17s"&gt;visit to Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, in which they spent a week performing and participating in workshops on Puerto Rican culture and STEM topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s concert was part of a project created by MIT Sounding Co-Director Frederick Harris Jr. called &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/hearing-amazonia-program/"&gt;Hearing Amazônia—The Responsibility of Existence&lt;/a&gt;. The project led to a trip in March, organized with assistance from graduate student &lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/node/219"&gt;Talia Khan ’20&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7xW4dWVzqE"&gt;brought over 80 MIT musicians&lt;/a&gt; to the Brazilian Amazon, where they met with indigenous communities, sharing music and other types of knowledge. That visit culminated in an event at the famous Teatro Amazonas opera house, featuring the MIT students and artists, local musicians from Manuas, and vocalist Djuena Tikuna, a member of the Tikuna People, Brazil’s largest indigenous Amazonian ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tikuna also performed at the MIT concert Saturday, leading Nós Somos A Floresta — Eware (Reflections on Amazonia) based on&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;lyrics from a traditional song of the Tikuna people. The stage was packed as Tikuna, accompanied by clarinetists Anat Cohen and Evan Ziporyn&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;percussionist David Rosado Ortiz, and all three student ensembles, delivered a heartfelt performance while a slideshow of photos by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Diego Janatã played in the background. Other performers throughout the evening included vocalists Sara Serpa and Laura Grill Jaye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tonight we celebrate,” said Agustín Rayo, dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, in remarks at the event. “We celebrate our new president, the artistry of our students, the power of collaboration and cultural exchange, and the unique ability of music to draw our attention to the natural world and our relationship to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Q&amp;A: Tod Machover on “Overstory Overture,” his new operatic work</title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/tod-machover-overstory-overture-new-operatic-work-0227</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Composers find inspiration from many sources. For renowned MIT Media Lab composer Tod Machover, reading the Richard Powers novel “The Overstory” instantly made him want to adapt it as an operatic composition. This might not seem an obvious choice to some: “The Overstory” is about a group of people, including a wrongly maligned scientist, who band together to save a forest from destruction. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But Machover’s resulting work, “Overstory Overture,” a 35-minute piece commissioned and performed by the chamber ensemble Sejong Soloists, has come to fruition and will have its world premiere on March 7 in Alice Tully Hall at New York’s Lincoln Center. Opera superstar Joyce DiDonato will have the lead role, with Earl Lee conducting. On March 16, the piece will have its second performance, in Seoul, South Korea. &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; recently talked to Machover about his original new work. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did you get the idea for your new work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been a fan of Richard Powers’ novels for a long time. He started out as a musician. He’s a cellist like I am, and was a composer before he was a writer, and he’s also been deeply interested in science for his whole career. All of his novels have something to do with people, ideas, music, and science. He’s always been on my radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s compelling to you about this particular Powers book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Overstory” is made up of many stories about characters who come together, improbably, because of trees. It starts with short chapters describing characters with relationships to trees. One is about a family that moved to the Midwest and planted a chestnut tree. It grows for 150 years and they take pictures every year, and it’s at the center of the family until it gets cut down in the 1990s. Another guy is in a plane in Vietnam and gets shot down, and his parachute gets caught in a tree right before he hits the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One character is named Patricia Westerford and she’s a scientist. Her life work is studying the forest and trees, and she discovers that trees communicate — both underground, through the roots, and through the air, via particles. They’re much more like a network than they are static, isolated objects. Her whole world is discovering the miracle of this network, but nobody believes her and she loses her tenure. And she basically goes and lives in the forest. Eventually all the characters in the book come together to preserve a forest in the Northwest that’s going to be destroyed. They become connected through trees, but in the book, all their lives are basically destroyed. It’s not a happy ending, but you understand how human beings are connected through the natural world, and have to think about this connection in a radically new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every single character came alive. The book is just a miracle. It’s a great work of art. Immediately, reading it, I thought, this is something I want to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did you start turning that into an operatic composition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I got in touch with Powers soon after that. Richard knew my music and answered immediately, saying, “I’d love to have you do an opera on this, and let’s figure out how.” I started working on it just before the pandemic. Around that time he came to Harvard to give a lecture, so he came here to my office in the Media Lab, and we got to chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally novels leave more room for you to decide how to make music out of them; they’re a lot less scripted than a movie or a play, and the many inner thoughts and asides leave room for music to fill in. I asked Richard, “Would you be interested in writing the text for this?” And right away he said, “Look, I’d like to be involved in the process, but I don’t feel equipped to write a libretto.” So, I went to Simon Robson, who worked on “Schoenberg in Hollywood” [another Machover opera], and we started working and checked in with Richard from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about that time the ensemble Sejong Soloists, who are based in New York and Seoul, offered to have their string orchestra collaborate on a project with a theatrical aspect, which was new for them. I explained I was working on an opera based on “The Overstory,” and I felt we could explore its themes. I could imagine the string instruments being like trees and the orchestra being the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing I did was contact my favorite singer, Joyce DiDonato. She’s such a beautiful, powerful singer. I did an opera in 1999 for Houston called “Resurrection,” which was based on Tolstoy’s last novel, and we were casting the main female character. We did auditions in New York, Los Angeles, and Europe, couldn’t find the main character, and finally the head of the Houston Grand Opera said, “You know, there’s this young singer in our apprentice program who’s pretty special, and you should hear her.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, that was Joyce. It was her first major role. We hadn’t done another project together although we remained close over the years, but I called her and said “Joyce, I know how busy you are, but I’ve got this idea, and I’ll send you the book. It’s great and I’d love to focus on this one character, would you consider doing it?” And she said she’d love to, partly because sustainability and the environment is something she really cares about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, but how do you get started writing music for a piece when it’s based on a book about trees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I began with two things. Musically I started with the idea of creating this language for tree communication. I was inspired by this idea that one of the reasons we don’t know about it is it’s underground, it’s low, it’s spreading out. I’m a cellist, and I’ve always loved music that grows from the bottom. When you play the cello, in a lot of the great literature, you’re playing the low part of a quartet or quintet or orchestra, and often people don’t quite hear it as the most prominent thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing I did was start making this text. Which was hard, because it’s a big novel. It’s a 35-minute piece where Joyce is at the center. When she starts, she just talks, for a minute, and then little by little it turns into song. It’s her sharing with everybody what she learned, she brings you into the world of the forest. In time, there’s a crisis, they’re destroying the forest, and as she says, they’re tearing out the lungs — tearing out the mind — of the world. The last part of the piece is a vision of how the trees need us but we need them even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t want to push too hard on this, but the composition sounds parallel with its subject matter. Trees are connected; an orchestra is connected. And then this story is about people building a connection to nature, while you want the audience to feel a connection to the piece. How much did you think about it that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I was thinking about that pretty consciously, and I really tried to make something that feels very still and simple, but where there’s a lot going on. It feels like it’s living and moving. The piece starts out with solo instruments, so at first everybody’s doing their bit, then they all join in. The strings make a rich ensemble sound, but in the last section every single instrument has its own part — I wrote an individual part for all these string players so they’re kind of weaving in and out. Musically it’s very much constructed to lead people through a forest that is both diverse but connected together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also enjoy using electronics to add another dimension. In this piece I’ve tried to create an electronic world that doesn’t necessarily remind you of electronics, except for one part where machines comes in ripping the forest apart. But mostly the electronics are blended with the orchestra in a way you might not always notice. The sound and feel, hopefully, will appear more natural than nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You also seem to have clearly identified a story with real operatic drama here, unusual as it may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The emotional transition that happens is the awareness of what the forest means, and in your gut what it means to protects it, and what it would mean to lose it, and then a glimpse of what it might feel like to live in a different way. I think the contribution someone like myself might be able to make is to change attitudes, to think about our limits as a species and as individuals. Technical solutions alone aren’t going to solve things; people’s behavior somehow has to change. A piece like this is a way of having the experience of crisis, and a vision of what could be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s something a lot of us want to know: What’s it like working with Joyce DiDonato?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; She’s one of those rare people. She’s completely direct and honest and lives life to the fullest. Joyce, I mean, thank God she has the best voice you’ll ever hear and she’s at the top of her game, but she also thinks about the world and ideas, and she did a whole project a few years ago performing a repertoire around the world about war and peace, to jolt people into a new understanding. Every project she’s involved with, she cares about the characters and she’s in it all the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this piece we did a bunch of Zoom sessions and tried things out. And she’s fantastic at saying, “To make that phrase the best you can for my voice at this point in the piece, would you consider changing that one note?” She has incredibly precise ideas about that. So, we worked musically on every detail and on the whole shape. What a pleasure! She also came here to MIT. She hadn’t been to the Media Lab, so she spent two days here at the beginning of August with her partner. She was so open to all the students and all the ideas and inventions and machines and software, just in the most gracious and truly excited way. You couldn’t have had a better visitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Any last thoughts about this piece you want to share?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; In my music in general, I’m pretty voracious at combining different things. I think in this project where it involves the natural world and the language of trees, and the language of melodies and instruments and electronic music, there may be more elements I’ve pulled together than ever. The emotional and even musical world here is larger. That’s my story here: These elements require and invite new thinking. And remember: This is just the first part of a larger project. I hope that you can hear the full&amp;nbsp;“Overstory” opera — perhaps with trees growing in a major opera house — in the not-so-distant future!&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/it-must-be-now/" target="_blank"&gt;It Must Be Now!&lt;/a&gt; is an initiative created in response to the racial reckoning of 2020. Multiple events for the MIT community were held throughout 2021 and 2022, leading to an historic multidisciplinary concert in Kresge Auditorium in May 2022, featuring new works by composers Terri Lyne Carrington, Braxton Cook, and Sean Jones, whose creations touched on the themes of racial justice. Some 150 student musicians and guest artists including turntablists, vocalists, spoken word artists, a dancer, and the renowned visual artist and filmmaker Mickalene Thomas also took part.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frederick Harris Jr., senior lecturer in music at MIT and music director of the MIT Wind Ensemble and MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble, initiated and leads the It Must Be Now! project, which is produced by MIT’s Center for Art, Science and Technology (CAST) and MIT Music and Theater Arts. Here, Harris discusses the project and describes how music can serve to advance social justice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is music such a powerful vehicle for storytelling around topics of social justice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Music goes straight to the heart. It communicates with nuance and visceral impact. It can be overt and ambiguous. It’s an incredible vehicle for freedom of expression, providing performers and listeners the opportunity for reflection, contemplation, joy, and celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has long been a prime force in telling the stories of the plight of Black Americans and other marginalized populations as well as celebrating their vast contributions. Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, Max Roach, Nina Simone, Abbey Lincoln, and many other major jazz artists have long addressed racial issues through their music and words. Today, new generations of musicians continue to sing and play their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The universality of music moves us — emotionally and physically — in unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the power to expand, challenge, and change the way we see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You created the It Must Be Now! initiative. What has been the impact on campus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Our six community events began deep conversations on topics like the common struggles, inherent truths, and sheer resilience of Black women, and Pangea (an ancient supercontinent) as an Afro-futurism vehicle, probing whether a more geographically linked world might make a difference in human relationships. The ideas and dialogues these events initiated created a rare space for students to explore their critical and creative thinking skills on matters of inequity and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The It Must Be Now! concert held in May 2022 embodied the themes of these events with the world premieres of compositions by leading musicians Terri Lyne Carrington, Braxton Cook, and Sean Jones. The 150 student musicians featured in the concert were a major part of how these celebrated artists told their stories. I think the experience gave all of us the courage to be better storytellers ourselves, finding our voices to keep the mission of human betterment in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary concept of It Must Be Now! — bringing together instrumental ensembles, vocalists, spoken word, turntablists, a dancer, and the renowned visual artist and filmmaker, Mickalene Thomas — gave the MIT community a response to the recent racial reckoning that reflected the magnitude and urgency of the situation. And it demonstrated the emotional power possible when bringing together all of these elements in one setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What would you hope to see as next steps for It Must Be Now! and for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Change requires a sustained effort. I think we need platforms for multitudes of voices from MIT and beyond our campus to embrace hard conversations about inequity and racism. And we need to continue to acknowledge and celebrate the lives and cultural contributions of those who have endured injustices historically and those who experience it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It Must Be Now! should provide more opportunities for students to expresses themselves and to use the storytelling power of the arts to draw attention to what is and isn’t working on campus. And students and administrative leaders need to be in regular dialog for mapping the future. Bringing DEI leaders to campus from K-12 education, other universities, government, and corporations will also help form a bridge to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can connect awareness and education to transformative actions and practices, MIT has a greater chance of making a difference in campus culture and being a leader in advancing DEI issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the It&amp;nbsp;Must Be Now! concert, Terri Lyne Carrington noted: “MIT has been in the forefront of moving the world forward in many ways, and it’s exciting to see new possibilities and potential from the Institution on this frontier as well. Change must be now. Justice must be now.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Comedy meets mathematics in a new opera at MIT</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Senior music lecturer Elena Ruehr turns Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, groundbreaking thinkers of modern computing, into crime fighters.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/comedy-meets-mathematics-mit-opera-lovelace-babbage-0223</guid>
        <dc:creator>Elisabeth Vincentelli | Arts at MIT</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of her career, the composer &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/elena-ruehr"&gt;Elena Ruehr&lt;/a&gt; has found inspiration in very different writers and very different worlds. She has, for example, set poems by Emily Dickinson and Langston Hughes to music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her latest project, “&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/thrilling-adventures-of-lovelace-and-babbage/"&gt;The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage&lt;/a&gt;,” recently premiered at MIT and marks another stylistic turn. And as with many artistic projects, the initial spark was serendipitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victorian scientific mavens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruehr, a senior lecturer in MIT Music and Theater Arts and a celebrated, versatile composer, was listening to National Public Radio while making dinner when she heard an interview with &lt;a href="https://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/"&gt;Sydney Padua&lt;/a&gt;, the author of a graphic novel imagining the 19th-century English prodigies Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage as crime-fighting sleuths — the book is subtitled “The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruehr’s ears immediately pricked up. One reason is that Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, and Ruehr has a particular interest in the famous Romantic poet. “Our family is famous for making things up, so you have to take this with a grain of salt,” she says, laughing, “but there’s a story that we are descendants of Lord Byron through an illegitimate child he had with a maid.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovelace was also a fascinating figure: She was a brilliant mathematician who collaborated with Babbage, a polymathic scientist credited for being one of the creators of the modern concept of computers. Ruehr bought Padua’s book,&amp;nbsp;loved it, and decided to adapt it into an opera in collaboration with the renowned librettist &lt;a href="http://www.roycevavrek.com/"&gt;Royce Vavrek&lt;/a&gt;, the winner of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Music for “Angel’s Bone” (with the composer Du Yun).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ruehr and Vavrek’s piece has finally premiered, about eight years after chancing on that radio show. That the project came to fruition at MIT — where it received a 2022-23 Visiting Artist Grant from the MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology (CAST), from the 2022-23 Ida Ely Rubin Visiting Artist Fund — felt entirely natural to Ruehr, and not simply because she has been teaching there since 1992. “Some of the students know this book and love it —&amp;nbsp;they would get it for Christmas,” she says. “I really wanted the opera to be produced at MIT because it seems to be such an important MIT kind of subject.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to get this unconventional project off the ground, Ruehr knew she would need unconventional collaborators, so she approached the Boston-based &lt;a href="https://guerillaopera.org/"&gt;Guerilla Opera&lt;/a&gt; and its artistic director, Aliana de la Guardia — who was not familiar with the main protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I'm not a math person, so I had no idea of either Lovelace or Babbage,” de la Guardia says. “What drew me to this opera is that it is not a ‘biopic opera,’ but it takes these two real characters and then it's like, ‘What if everything just turned crazy?’ We see mathematics used in a whimsical way, like the old cartoon ‘&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/U_ZHsk0-eF0"&gt;Donald in Mathmagic Land&lt;/a&gt;.’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruehr wrote with the Guerilla Opera musicians in mind, so her piece uses a violin, cello, clarinet, and percussion, along with four singers (including de la Guardia and Aaron Engebreth as the title characters). But of course, this modest size also is a practical asset. “That's a very lean opera —&amp;nbsp;it's only got eight people — which is great because it’s hard to raise money for modern opera, so you want to make it very easy to produce,” Ruehr says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steampunk meets whimsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that the work thinks small, however. Musically ambitious, “The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage” lands in the blurry area between musical theater and opera, with Ruehr putting her own spin on the steampunk aesthetic that is very present in the source material. “To me, steampunk combines the old and the new, so that's how I approached it,” she says. “I wanted to have a structural and musical style that was a little bit like Rossini — the most popular opera composer at the time of Lovelace and Babbage — but then have a layer of modernism on top of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a coincidence that Rossini was a master of comic opera, or that de la Guardia mentioned whimsy, because the new project is faithful to the graphic novel’s rambunctious spirit and is not afraid of levity. Ruehr points out that while contemporary classical music has evolved and is now more approachable than it might have been 20 to 50 years ago, “the humor factor is very rare, and I don't understand why. Some of the smartest people on the planet are comedians,” she adds, “and I don't understand why humor isn't as artistically valued as anything else.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistically spurred by MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ruehr, teaching at MIT has played a central role in the evolution of her own music, and she is both challenged and spurred by her students. “They want to know, ‘How is it that we hear sound and we have an emotional response?’” she says. “They're not going to say, ‘That sounds like Mozart so it's good.’ They're going to say, ‘Why does it work?’ I realized that I could bang my head against the wall trying to make something complicated and it would never satisfy them because they would get it instantly,” she continues. “But to write something that engaged them emotionally, that was a little bit of a challenge. There are dance numbers in my piece, a sense of rhythm that's kind of more regular than a lot of modern music because I'm trying to appeal to that emotional response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “Lovelace and Babbage” is an engaging, approachable piece, it does not sacrifice musical sophistication. “I do not think that accessible means dumbed down — I take a stand about that,” Ruehr says. “I actually think that accessible and intelligent and smart is very possible, and it is my mission as an artist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production was presented by &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/cast/"&gt;CAST,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mta.mit.edu"&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="http://www.guerillaopera.org"&gt; Guerilla Opera&lt;/a&gt;. Additional project development support was received from the &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/camit/funding/"&gt;Council for the Arts at MIT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/resources/internal/deflorez"&gt;DeFlorez Fund for Humor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Exploring the rich traditions of Brazilian music</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Students studying the Portuguese language pair with musicians for special event at Lewis Library.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Lisa Hickler | MIT Global Languages</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Student presentations tackled themes of identity, nation-building, racism, multiculturalism, and more, as reflected in the rich traditions of Brazilian music at “The Beat of Brazil” last month at the Lewis Music Library. The presentations were by students of Portuguese enrolled in class 21G.821 (The Beat of Brazil: Portuguese Language Through Brazilian Society), taught by Nilma Dominique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three professional musicians were invited to perform as part of the event: Anna Borges and Bill Ward (from the duo Receita de Samba), along with Grammy Award-winning drummer Rafael Barata. After each student spoke about the historical and cultural context for a particular Brazilian style of music, the musicians performed selections in the discussed styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theo St. Francis (an MIT senior in aeronautics and astronautics) explained Brazil’s history of enslaving Africans to work in the sugar fields. He said, “With the workers came their traditions in food, crafts, religion, and mythology, and especially music and dance. … This forced mixing of cultures rendered a brilliant mix of rhythms and sounds among the three primary influences — African, European, and Native Brazilian.” He explained that the music genre choro is imbued with “influences from lundu dances from Angola, the maxixe&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or Brazilian tango (itself a mix of African rhythms with European polka dance of that time), as well as flute rhythms from European musicians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samba is not really just one genre, but “is better thought of as the backbone of most genres in Brazil,” explained Alessandre Santos, an MIT senior in mathematics. Samba has strong roots in African music, and contains within it many sub-genres. But throughout Brazil’s history, music has been a site for conflicting forces. Modern samba has been reclaimed by Afro-Brazilians as a kind of resistance to racist oppression. Santos explained that samba-canção is a very poetic variant of samba, characterized by soft melodies and slow rhythms, and two examples of this style were performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laura Leal de Souza, a junior at Wellesley College majoring in Latin American Studies, made a&amp;nbsp;remote presentation over a large monitor. She explained that the samba-exaltação nomenclature first appeared in 1939. She explained, “Composers began to write lyrics that worshiped Brazil and the government.” This was used “to create a sense of ‘Brazilianness’ in Brazilian citizens in order to facilitate the dictatorship later implemented by [then-president] Vargas.” She also described the emergence of samba-enredo in the same period, which became strongly identified with government-backed “samba schools,” becoming “the main rhythm of the Brazilian carnival, characterized by its strong percussion and themes that portray specific elements of Brazilian culture.” Leal de Souza also presented on the protest music of the 1960s later in the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of television and radio was discussed by Ygor Moura, an MIT junior majoring in chemistry, who explained how that media helped to propagate and essentialize aspects of Brazilian culture. The U.S. government’s “Good Neighbor Policy” of the 1930s sought to advance U.S. interests in Central and South America through trade and other means. He pointed to the promotion of Broadway actress and film star Carmen Miranda as the “origin of most of the visual stereotypes Americans have about Brazilians.” Moura also discussed the role of Brazilian music festivals, which became sites for protest during the Brazilian dictatorship of 1964-85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best-known Brazilian songs, “The Girl from Ipanema,” is an example of bossa nova (Portuguese for “new wave”), explained Dasha Castillo, an MIT senior in computation and cognition. Castillo explained that this music moved away from samba’s larger group ensembles, toward arrangements typically focus on a “lone singer with a guitar, or a singer with another accompanist on another instrument like a piano.” The best-known artists associated with bossa nova are Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinícius de Moraes, and João Gilberto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upbeat music interludes inspired some audience members to get up and dance during the event. One highlight of the evening was a performance by three MIT students (Allessandre Santos, Ygor Moura, and Dasha Castillo) of the well-known Brazilian song “Águas de Março,” known in English as “Waters of March,” accompanied by drummer Rafael Barata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nilma Dominique has offered several classes over the years that teach Portuguese language skills through the vehicle of either film or music. “Language and culture go hand-in-hand,” she said. In her class 21G.821, Dominique guides students in examining Brazilian music genres with within a historical context, and “analyzing cultural production from a transnational perspective ... Throughout the course, there was a strong emphasis on developing critical thinking, often centering discussions on how Brazilian musical production reflects questions of identity, social class, race, inequality, and politics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nilma Dominique explained that the Lewis Music library was not just the venue for the event. The staff and student workers at Lewis played a key role in publicizing the event, and event setup and staffing. She added, “This was actually the second time I had the pleasure of working in partnership with the Lewis Library to put on a program of Brazilian music."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the event, Avery Boddie, the Rosalind Denny Lewis Music Library department head, explained that the library was involved as a continuation of the tradition of “offering engaging programming and outreach to the MIT community through workshops, lectures, and in this case, concerts.” He also pointed out that the library has a “vast collection on music from most regions of the world, including Brazilian music, so any opportunity to support research and education in diverse genres of music across different cultures is something that we value strongly in our department. And who doesn’t enjoy a little samba?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for the program was from the Council for the Arts at MIT, the Kelly Douglas Fund through the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and the MIT Brazilian Student Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some attendees provided post-event comments. Abby Mrvos said, “The Beat of Brazil show was an absolute treat. The performances were a joy to watch, and the introductions by the students really gave color and context to the experience. I would love to see more events like this in the future!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Heath agreed, saying: “Listening to a captivating live performance of a selection of Brazilian music along with its historical context, my mind took a journey through time in Brazil, a much-needed escape after a long semester.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[AeroAstro major and accomplished tuba player Frederick Ajisafe relishes the community he has found in the MIT Wind Ensemble.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Laura Rosado | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How does an ensemble play music together while apart? This was the question facing Frederick Ajisafe and the rest of the MIT Wind Ensemble (MITWE) at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. One method was to individually record tracks that were later mixed together to sound like a full ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a strange experience,” says Ajisafe, who plays the tuba and is pursuing a double major in aerospace engineering and music. “It wasn’t as cohesive as playing together in person, but the results are something to be proud of.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the group is able to rehearse in person once again, Ajisafe has a renewed appreciation for the community he has found within MITWE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As far as the togetherness of the ensemble, the intangible and social connections that we all have, I feel like we’re back in that sense,” he says. “The biggest difference is that I’m a senior. The last time we were together without masks, I was a freshman looking up to people, but now people are looking up to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accomplished musician, Ajisafe has been playing the tuba since middle school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In middle school, I heard a lot of things like ‘music makes you smarter,’ so I said, ‘okay, I want to be smarter,’ so I joined the band program,” says Ajisafe. “Something about my lip shape and my lung capacity was really good for the tuba.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was more than just a physical affinity for the instrument that kept Ajisafe playing; he also loved the social aspect of playing in an ensemble. Last year, he was accepted as an Emerson Scholar in tuba performance, receiving subsidized private lessons with renowned professional tuba player Ken Amis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ajisafe has also taken a variety of classes in MIT’s Music and Theater Arts section that cover a wide range of topics, from traditional theory to composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of his favorite classes is 21M.361 (Electronic Music Composition), which teaches how to sample and manipulate sounds in different software. Some of the sounds Ajisafe sampled throughout the course of the class include snapping, clapping, playing a scale on his tuba, and slamming an object on the ground. Then, those sounds were fit to a score Ajisafe created for a previous assignment. He described the process as intellectually satisfying, as well as pushing the envelope in how he understands music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most people probably wouldn’t call it music, but it has musical elements,” says Ajisafe. “It gives you a new perspective on the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From spelling bees to natural language processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ajisafe grew up in Orlando, Florida, and had a wide range of interests growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever they were teaching in school, I was excited about,” he says. “I was always interested in words and things like that, but I was also interested in science and math.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up close to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, it’s easy to see how Ajisafe cultivated an interest in aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Aerospace engineering is the most exciting field within engineering right now,” says Ajisafe. “And you can see it with all of the stuff going on in Florida. Seeing all the rocket launches inspired me to pick aerospace engineering and once I got into it, it confirmed that more and more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was also a childhood participation in the local spelling bee that tickled his interest in words. Now, he’s working on a project, through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, that combines linguistics, natural language processing, and aircraft design requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of writing design requirements for aircraft is ambiguity, especially when the requirements are written in traditional, natural language form. More engineers are turning to model-based systems engineering standards, which is newer and more formalized. Ajisafe is tackling the problem of translating the original requirements into the newer form, specifically, putting together representative training data for a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m figuring out the more granular level to label these sorts of sentences to figure out if we could use a more automatic system using parts of speech,” Ajisafe explains. “For example, maybe you can devise a pattern that labels a noun at the beginning of a sentence as the entity important to systems engineers, like ‘the parachute shall deploy at this time’ — the parachute is the entity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of converting every detail of the sentence to a system model, his team has determined that it’s effective to focus on labeling and extracting certain key elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project combines many different skills that Ajisafe has picked up throughout his MIT career, all coming together in harmony to tackle a unique problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I always want to see the next thing beyond”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next year, Ajisafe plans to pursue his master’s degree through the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, I would like to be working with the technical problems related to space exploration and getting humanity to the stars,” says Ajisafe. “I don’t know exactly where I fit in that, but hopefully I can have a positive impact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, like it’s been throughout his life, he wants to continue doing music, whether it be playing tuba or trying other outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For humanity to survive, it is good and maybe even necessary to seek out other places besides Earth,” Ajisafe says with regards to his career aspirations. But, it connects to how he approaches his personal life as well: “I always want to walk out somewhere I’ve never been before and be in a place that I’m completely unfamiliar with. I always want to see the next thing beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Machine learning and the arts: A creative continuum</title>

  <description><![CDATA[CAST Visiting Artist Andreas Refsgaard engages the MIT community in the ethics and play of creative coding.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sketch a doodle of a drum or a saxophone to conjure a multi-instrumental composition. Look into a webcam, speak, and watch your mouth go bouncing across the screen — the input for a series of charmingly clunky chain reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what visitors to the MIT Lewis Music Library encounter when they interact with two new digital installations, “Doodle Tunes” and “Sounds from the Mouth,” created by &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/machine-learning-and-the-arts/"&gt;2022-23 Center for Art and Technology (CAST) Visiting Artist Andreas Refsgaard&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with Music Technology and Digital Media Librarian Caleb Hall. The residency was initiated by Avery Boddie, Lewis Music Library department head, who recognized Refsgaard’s flair for revealing the playfulness of emerging technologies. The intricacies of coding and machine learning can seem daunting to newcomers, but Refsgaard’s practice as a creative coder, interaction designer, and educator seeks to open the field to all. Encompassing workshops, an artist talk, class visits, and an exhibition, the residency was infused with his unique sense of humor — a combination of lively eccentricity and easygoing relatability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning through laughter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refsgaard, who is based in Copenhagen, is a true maverick of machine learning. “I’m interested in the ways we can express ourselves through code,” he explains. “I like to make unconventional connections between inputs and outputs, with the computer serving as a translator — a tool might allow you to play music with your eyes, or it might generate a love poem from a photo of a burrito.” Refsgaard’s particular spin on innovation isn’t about directly solving problems or launching world-changing startups. Instead, he simply seeks to “poke at what can be done,” providing accessible open-source templates to prompt new creative ideas and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmed by Refsgaard and featuring a custom set of sounds created by Hall, “Doodle Tunes” and “Sounds from the Mouth” demonstrate how original compositions can be generated through a mix of spontaneous human gestures and algorithmically produced outputs. In “Doodle Tunes,” a machine learning algorithm is trained on a dataset of drawings of different instruments: a piano, drums, bass guitar, or saxophone. When the user sketches one of these images on a touchscreen, a sound is generated; the more instruments you add, the more complex the composition. “Sounds from the Mouth” works through facial tracking and self-capturing images. When the participant faces a webcam and opens their mouth, an autonomous snapshot is created which bounces off the notes of a piano. To try the projects for yourself, scroll to the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries, unlimited&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saxophone squeals and digital drum beats aren’t the only sounds issuing from the areas where the projects are installed. “My office is close by,” says Hall. “So when I suddenly hear laughter, I know exactly what’s up.” This new sonic dimension of the Lewis Music Library fits with the ethos of the environment as a whole — designed as a campus hub for audio experimentation, the library was never intended to be wholly silent. Refsgaard’s residency exemplifies a new emphasis on progressive programming spearheaded by Boddie, as the strategy of the library shifts toward a focus on digital collections and music technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In addition to serving as a space for quiet study and access to physical resources, we want the library to be a place where users congregate, collaborate, and explore together,” says Boddie. “This residency was very successful in that regard. Through the workshops, we were able to connect individuals from across the MIT community and their unique disciplines. We had people from the Sloan School of Management, from the Schwarzman College of Computing, from Music and Theater Arts, all working together, getting messy, creating tools that sometimes worked … and sometimes didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error and serendipity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of error is a key quality of Refgaard’s work. Occasional glitches are part of the artistry, and they also serve to gently undermine the hype around AI; an algorithm is only as good as its dataset, and that set is inflected by human biases and oversights. During a public artist talk, “Machine Learning and the Arts,” audience members were initiated into Refsgaard’s offbeat artistic paradigm, presented with projects such as &lt;a href="https://andreasrefsgaard.dk/projects/books-by-AI/"&gt;Booksby.ai&lt;/a&gt; (an online bookstore for AI-produced sci-fi novels), &lt;a href="https://andreasrefsgaard.dk/projects/is-it-funky/"&gt;Is it FUNKY?&lt;/a&gt; (an attempt to distinguish between “fun” and “boring” images), and &lt;a href="https://andreasrefsgaard.dk/projects/eye-conductor/"&gt;Eye Conductor&lt;/a&gt; (an interface to play music via eye movements and facial gestures). Glitches in the exhibit installations were frankly admitted (it’s true that “Doodle Tunes” occasionally mistakes a drawing of a saxophone for a squirrel), and Refsgaard encouraged audience members to suggest potential improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This open-minded attitude set the tone of the workshops “Art, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence” and “Machine Learning for Interaction Designers,” intended to be suitable for newcomers as well as curious experts. Refsgaard’s visits to music technology classes explored the ways that human creativity could be amplified by machine learning, and how to navigate the sliding scale between artistic intention and unexpected outcomes. “As I see it, success is when participants engage with the material and come up with new ideas. The first step of learning is to understand what is being taught — the next is to apply that understanding in ways that the teacher couldn’t have foreseen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertainty and opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refsgaard’s work exemplifies some of the core values and questions central to the evolution of MIT Libraries — issues of digitization, computation, and open access. By choosing to make his lighthearted demos freely accessible, he renounces ownership of his ideas; a machine learning model might serve as a learning device for a student, and it might equally be monetized by a corporation. For Refsgaard, play is a way of engaging with the ethical implications of emerging technologies, and Hall found himself grappling with these questions in the process of creating the sounds for the two installations. “If I wrote the sound samples, but someone else arranged them as a composition, then who owns the music? Or does the AI own the music? It’s an incredibly interesting time to be working in music technology; we’re entering into unknown territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Refsgaard, uncertainty is the secret sauce of his algorithmic artistry. “I like to make things where I’m surprised by the end result,” he says. “I’m seeking that sweet spot between something familiar and something unexpected.” As he explains, too much surprise simply amounts to noise, but there’s something joyful in the possibility that a machine might mistake a saxophone for a squirrel. The task of a creative coder is to continually tune the relationship between human and machine capabilities — to find and follow the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://andreasref.github.io/doodleTunesOnlineMIT/"&gt;Doodle Tunes&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://andreasref.github.io/soundsFromTheMouth/main/"&gt;Sounds from the Mouth&lt;/a&gt;” are on display in the MIT Lewis Music Library (14E-109) until Dec. 20.

  <title>Spreading joy with Wide Tim</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT senior Tianyuan (Margaret) Zheng uses art as a bonding enzyme to join STEM, culture, and community.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 16:20:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/spreading-joy-with-wide-tim-1129</guid>
        <dc:creator>Sarah Foote | Division of Student Life</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;He has his own &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/wide_tim/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; account. He stars as the featured profile picture on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MITAdmissions"&gt;MIT Admission’s Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page. When MIT’s Campus Preview Weekend 2022 came around, he joyfully opened his arms widely to welcome the admitted Class of 2026 at a campus photo booth. You can find him everywhere on campus, from murals and posters in the MIT Welcome Center to laptop stickers, pins, and keychains on a student’s backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this isn’t MIT’s iconic mascot, Tim the Beaver. This is Wide Tim, an adorable beaver character who loves MIT, obtaining width, and injecting some levity into MIT life. Rumor has it that Wide Tim double-majors in eating and sleeping, but his sole mission is to make people happy and smile. And by all accounts, he excels at his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide Tim is the brainchild of senior Tianyuan (Margaret) Zheng, a double major in &lt;a href="https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/index.html"&gt;Course 18&lt;/a&gt; (Mathematics) and &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science/"&gt;6-14&lt;/a&gt; (Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science), with a &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/degree-requirements/music-minor"&gt;minor in music&lt;/a&gt;. Growing up in Qingdao, China, and later Mobile, Alabama, her love of the arts has always been as strong as her love of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zheng aspired to attend MIT ever since her first campus visit at age 10. “I remember seeing professors, students, and thousands of posters for all kinds of activities on the Infinite Corridor — I was mesmerized. I thought, ‘there are so many things to do here!’” says Zheng.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to furthering her studies in mathematics, economics, and computer science, she naturally gravitates toward creative outlets to combine her technical interests with artistic endeavors. She is the co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/big_dijkstra_energy/"&gt;a comedic Instagram account&lt;/a&gt; with Gloria Lin ’22 and juniors Audrey Cui and Penny Brant, which explains complex STEM concepts with art, humor, and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide Tim was born as a spinoff from that page during the week of Valentine’s Day on an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLPr1dgnLd5/?hl=en"&gt;@mitadmissions guest post&lt;/a&gt;. As MIT Admissions began to adopt more drawings of Wide Tim in collaboration with Zheng, his popularity grew rapidly among MIT students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Wide Tim has become a kind of unofficial representation of our mascot with all of his stats maximized: friendliness, cuteness, potential hug-ability,” says Chris Peterson, director of special projects for MIT Admissions and Student Financial Services. “What began as a small piece of digital fan art posted to the Admissions’ Instagram account to welcome the 2024s to campus for their first in-person semester has expanded, both literally and figuratively, to encompass the entire community, as infinite as the eponymous corridor itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson, who has worked with Zheng to create more materials featuring Wide Tim, isn’t surprised that the rotund beaver has been such a big hit with current and prospective students. “It’s simple physics: attraction is directly proportional to mass, so as Wide Tim becomes larger and larger, people love him more and more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the character gained momentum, Zheng created an Instagram account for Wide Tim to promote art and creativity on campus. She partners with many student-run art and cultural organizations that depict Wide Tim participating in numerous campus events, free of charge. “I wanted more people to know that MIT not only excels in STEM, but also encompasses such a rich collection of artistic talents, quirkiness, and culture — and on top of this, MIT students know how to have fun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide Tim is not Zheng’s first experience in MIT art organizations or beaver drawing. She has been an executive board member of &lt;a href="http://borderline.mit.edu/"&gt;The Borderline&lt;/a&gt;, an art club that created MIT’s 200-foot-long, augmented-reality mural tunnel, as well as an artist on Ring Committee 2023, a 12-student committee selected by each class to design a &lt;a href="https://brassrat2023.mit.edu/"&gt;unique MIT ring&lt;/a&gt; for their fellow classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her free time, she loves to improvise on the piano, sometimes during jam sessions organized by McCormick Hall, where she also serves as a co-president. “I have to admit that I’ve over-committed every semester,” she says, “but I love my communities at MIT so much, that I constantly want to do something to make them even happier places to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some extra help from Wide Tim.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Teresa Gao named 2024 Mitchell Scholar</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2022/teresa-gao-named-2024-mitchell-scholar-1123</link>
  <description><![CDATA[The MIT senior will pursue postgraduate studies in computer science in Ireland.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 10:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/teresa-gao-named-2024-mitchell-scholar-1123</guid>
        <dc:creator>Julia Mongo | Office of Distinguished Fellowships</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT senior Teresa Gao has been named one of the 12 winners of the George J. Mitchell Scholarship’s Class of 2024. After graduating next spring with a double major in computer science and engineering as well as brain and cognitive sciences, she will study augmented and virtual reality at Trinity College Dublin. Gao is the fifth MIT student to be named a Mitchell Scholar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Scholars are selected on the basis of academic achievement, leadership, and dedication to public service. The scholarship is named in honor of U.S. Senator George Mitchell’s contributions to the Northern Ireland peace process. This year, over 300 American students were endorsed to apply for the prestigious fellowship, which is sponsored by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance and funds a year of graduate studies in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Teresa’s excellent work at the intersections of engineering, music, and science communication make the Mitchell Scholarship in Ireland a perfect fit for her next step,” says Kim Benard, associate dean of distinguished fellowships in Career Advising and Professional Development. “We are proud that she will be representing MIT there, as she exemplifies the mind and hand ethos of our education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gao, a resident of Provo, Utah, is interested in artificial intelligence and the development of autonomous agents. She has conducted research in a range of fields, including psycholinguistics in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, social robots for mental health in the Media Lab, and machine learning architectures for biological images at the Broad Institute. Currently, she is working to establish cognitive benchmarks for AI with the MIT Quest for Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gao’s love for science is only equaled by her passion for creativity and the arts. She hosts an educational radio show, “Psycholochat: Where Neuroscience Meets Philosophy,” on the MIT campus radio station WMBR 88.1 FM, where she investigates topics in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completely self-taught on the viola, Gao earned a highly competitive seat in the MIT Chamber Music Society. She also serves as co-president of Ribotones, a student group that plays music in service to hospital patients and nursing home residents throughout the Greater Boston community, and she performs with the competitive MIT Bhangra dance team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the arts, Gao tutors fellow MIT students through the IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu Honor Society, manages logistics for the annual Battlecode programming competition fun by MIT’s computer science department, and volunteers with the peer support anonymous campus textline, Lean On Me.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it came to picking a major, Skylar Larsen had no doubt in her mind that she wanted to study the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was never really an 'aha' moment,” says Larsen. “I always loved staring up into space.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunity to further explore astronomy came in high school, when Larsen participated in Boyce-Astro, a local outreach organization that aims to expose students to the scientific research process. Through their seminar program, she was able to take data from remote telescopes, write a few papers, and publish them in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe I got to do that in high school,” Larsen says. “Scientific writing is a really important skill to have, and the fact that early on I was exposed to a program that taught kids these things was huge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larsen considers her time with Boyce-Astro to be the start of her career as an astronomer. She’s returned to mentor other students in the program, passing on not only the skills of observational astronomy but also how to effectively communicate those findings through writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a senior in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Larsen has continued to look toward the stars and enjoy the hands-on coursework that comes with it. One class that stands out is 12.410 (Observational Techniques of Optical Astronomy). As a communication intensive class, it equips students with the skillset needed to write research proposals, take observatory data, and then present that data at conferences. Under normal circumstances, the class requires late nights at the MIT Wallace Astrophysical Observatory, but due to the Covid-19 restrictions Larsen and her classmates were limited to taking data remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, she got to experience those late nights at the observatory during an internship the following summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As an astronomer, you’re at the mercy of the weather,” Larsen says, going on to explain that she spent late nights at the observatory three to four times a week as an intern. “You have two options. Either you have a bonked sleep schedule and you’re going to be totally miserable, or you become nocturnal. I tried to do the second one. It turns out I’m slightly bad at that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of sleep, Larsen says joyfully, “I’m so glad I got to experience that. I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I ask myself, is this just something that I’m doing because younger me wanted to do it?” Larsen wonders. “But I’ve always loved astronomy. I’ve always wanted to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While astronomy was always a passion for Larsen, digital art was something she discovered once she came to college. She’s been an active member of Digital Art and Animation at MIT, or DAAMIT, since her first year and is now the president of the club. In her role she helps to organize weekly hangouts, monthly art challenges, and a yearly anthology of members’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through her participation in DAAMIT, Larsen had the opportunity to collaborate with MIT music lecturer and composer Elena Ruehr. Ruehr had reached out to the club to commission animated shorts to go with a collection of musical pieces for string quartets she had written. The aim of the project was to merge music and animation to introduce kids to the arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larsen herself wore many hats throughout the project, taking on the role of lead background artist as well as working on the storyboard and character designs. The project started with a team of two, but quickly expand to eight as they realized the true scope of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In our hubris, we thought we could get a lot more done,” says Larsen, noting that this was the most ambitious animation project she’s ever tackled. “That four-minute-long short film — that took a year to make.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That four-minute short film goes with the composition’s first movement, “&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/news/news-2022-spider-swing-video-animation-music-elena-ruehr" target="_blank"&gt;Spider Swing&lt;/a&gt;,” and tells the story of a family of insects throwing an increasingly complicated dance party while their frazzled spider butler scrambles to put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is still ongoing — there are five more movements to finish — and is being worked on by other students in the DAAMIT community. All are being funded through the UROP office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“UROPs don’t have to be in the field of study you’re majoring in,” says Larsen. “It can just be super cool stuff that you really want to do. Not many people can say they’ve completed an animated short film. I can say that!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larsen has also taken many classes in the comparative media studies department, studying everything from video game design to the art of making comics. These classes have been an avenue to improve her art, but she also sees them as a chance to make science topics more accessible to a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To say that planetary science is currently booming is a gross understatement. It’s exploding right now,” says Larsen, referring to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. “I would love to work with exoplanet data from the JWST, or on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But I also don’t want it to be all pedantic science. I really love to use my art as a science communicator. Making comics, making videos games — I would love to try and use those mediums to bring science topics to kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday night, MIT came out to party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An all-Institute dance party, organized by L. Rafael Reif as a thank you to the community as he &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/rafael-reif-to-step-down-mit-president-0210"&gt;approaches the conclusion&lt;/a&gt; of his tenure as MIT’s 17th president, was attended by thousands of students, staff, faculty, and their guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The festivities opened with a community café dinner, with refreshments available to party-goers all night long. Multiple locations across campus hosted dancing and music — from 60s, 70s, and 80s tunes at the Boardwalk Arcade in Rockwell Cage to an a cappella showcase by MIT student groups at the Johnson Ice Rink to live bands at Kresge Oval and the ice rink, playing jazz, reggae, salsa, R&amp;amp;B, and more. Meanwhile, Killian Court was transformed into a night club lounge and mega DJ show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Saturday evening on Killian Court, it was not clear how to squeeze even one more person on the dance floor,” Reif wrote to the community on Monday. “Chris and I went everywhere — the arcade, the spectacular a cappella showcase, the wonderful dancing tents. I’m grateful to all of you who were able to come and add your own joyful energy. And to every member of the enormous team that made this dream party come true for our community: Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I could not have asked for a more delightful memory of the people of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A passion for science and music</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Fieldwork campfire jam sessions and geology lessons helped inspire senior Zoe Levitt to pursue songwriting full time.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/passion-science-and-music-zoe-levitt-0602</guid>
        <dc:creator>Paige Colley | EAPS</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the quiet hall outside of Hayden Library, Zoe Levitt’s soft, musical voice fills the room. The acoustics are perfect for amplifying her words and her innate passion for geology. Or, more specifically, paleomagnetism — using magnetism to study the geological history of the Earth — which is the focus of her senior thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The question is, when did plate tectonics actually start?” Levitt explains, her hands moving in rhythm with her words. “Was it intermittent? Or was it continuous?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a senior in Course 12 (Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, or EAPS), it seems like Levitt is on track to head off to graduate school and further her geological pursuits elsewhere. But she’s not. Levitt’s time at MIT has been filled with unexpected surprises, including choosing geology as her major in the first place. Now that she’s finished, she’s settled on an entirely different field: songwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really have loved studying geology,” she explains. “But right now, I really feel the need to pursue music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levitt grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, no stranger to the people of MIT and their passion. When she arrived at MIT, she had been thinking of majoring in math or engineering. But she was persuaded to major in geology after signing up for a Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP) to &lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/news/2017/DEAPS-Yellowstone-2017"&gt;Yellowstone&lt;/a&gt; and Grand Teton national parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I really applied for the trip just because I wanted to get out of Boston and go see somewhere else,” she laughs, confessing that the idea of just going to restaurants or other places in the area seemed too boring. The trip also coincided with the 2017 eclipse, so between that, hiking, and learning about geology with experts, Levitt was sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did geology research the summer after her first year, working with a postdoc in Kristin Bergmann’s lab, where they looked at 1.8-billion-year-old rocks to try to understand the oxygen environment at the time of their creation. She did her first field work trip to Michigan, and then in the fall returned to Yellowstone on the FPOP trip, this time as a teaching assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think EAPS is really special in that you get to go on these trips into the field with professors and really get to know them and get to know their expertise,” she says. One of her favorite EAPS moments was a trip in January 2020. The field cook had brought a guitar and Levitt brought her mandolin, and together they jammed around the campfire while everyone chatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music has long been a part of Levitt’s life. Her father bought her a Baby Taylor guitar for her sixth birthday, and she switched to mandolin as her primary instrument a few years later. She grew up in the bluegrass scene, attending festivals with her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was always really driven by the melodies of compositions, but I never really paid attention to the words,” she explains. “I was going through a pretty tough time and ended up starting to write songs to process what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spring 2020, Levitt was ready to take a serious step into songwriting, so she reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.celiawoodsmith.com/"&gt;Celia Woodsmith&lt;/a&gt;, a Grammy Award-nominated musician. Woodsmith, like many musicians whose plans were disrupted by the pandemic, agreed to lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levitt’s songwriting first began as a way for her to process her emotions and experiences as a sexual assault survivor. She has since shared her songs to raise awareness, including recording two songs about her experience as a survivor for National Public Radio’s Tiny Desk Contest and performing an autobiographical piece in the 2022 MIT monologues. She also performed at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center’s Walk for Change and recorded a song for the Cambridge Women’s Center’s video commemorating their 50th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hope that sharing my songs can bring healing to others as it has for me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Levitt has been using her “curiosity and a passion for discovery” from her time in EAPS to explore new topics in her music, such as mental health struggles, historical narratives, and satirical songs. Her song “We Flattened the Curve”, comments satirically on the U.S. Covid-19 response using mathematical observations. Levitt, who in addition to majoring in geology is minoring in both music and math, jokes that she’s “already putting that math degree to some good use!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Levitt officially graduated in the spring, she isn’t done with MIT just yet. She was awarded an &lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/students/resources/eloranta/"&gt;Eloranta&lt;/a&gt; Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, which she’ll be using to further her musical pursuits. This fall she hopes to travel to Nepal to collaborate with local musicians on a project recording and transcribing traditional music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she isn’t done with geology, either. She’ll be spending six weeks doing fieldwork with EAPS Professor Oliver Jagoutz in the Himalayas in July.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I haven't made it out to the field since [2020] so I'm really excited to get back out there,” she says. “In the fall I'll be focusing on sharing my music for the time being, and then see what happens from there.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Q&amp;A: Latifah Hamzah ’12 on creating sustainable solutions in Malaysia and beyond </title>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2022/qa-latifah-hamzah-creating-sustainable-solutions-malaysia-and-beyond-0318</guid>
        <dc:creator>Turner Jackson | MIT Energy Initiative</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Latifah Hamzah &lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;12 graduated from MIT with a BS in mechanical engineering and minors in energy studies and music. During their time at MIT, Latifah participated in various student organizations, including the MIT Symphony Orchestra, Alpha Phi Omega, and the MIT Design/Build/Fly team. They also participated in the MIT Energy Initiative’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) in the lab of former professor of mechanical engineering Alexander Mitsos, examining solar-powered thermal and electrical co-generation systems. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After graduating from MIT, Latifah worked as a subsea engineer at Shell Global Solutions and co-founded Engineers Without Borders &lt;/em&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Malaysia, a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding sustainable and empowering solutions that impact disadvantaged populations in Malaysia. More recently, Latifah received a master of science in mechanical engineering from Stanford University, where they are currently pursuing a PhD in environmental engineering with a focus on water and sanitation in developing contexts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What inspired you to pursue energy studies as an undergraduate student at MIT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I grew up in Malaysia, where I was at once aware of both the extent to which the oil and gas industry is a cornerstone of the economy and the need to transition to a lower-carbon future. The energy studies minor was therefore enticing because it gave me a broader view of the energy space, including technical, policy, economic, and other viewpoints. This was my first exposure to how things worked in the real world — in that many different fields and perspectives had to be considered cohesively in order to have a successful, positive, and sustained impact. Although the minor was predominantly grounded in classroom learning, what I learned drove me to want to discover for myself how the forces of technology, society, and policy interacted in the field in my subsequent endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the breadth that the minor added to my education, it also provided a structure and focus for me to build on my technical fundamentals. This included taking graduate-level classes and participating in UROPs that had specific energy foci. These were my first forays into questions that, while still predominantly technical, were more open-ended and with as-yet-unknown answers that would be substantially shaped by the framing of the question. This shift in mindset required from typical undergraduate classes and problem sets took a bit of adjusting to, but ultimately gave me the confidence and belief that I could succeed in a more challenging environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did these experiences with energy help shape your path forward, particularly in regard to your work with Engineers Without Borders – Malaysia and now at Stanford?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; When I returned home after graduation, I was keen to harness my engineering education and explore in practice what the energy studies minor curriculum had taught by theory and case studies: to consider context, nuance, and interdisciplinary and myriad perspectives to craft successful, sustainable solutions. Recognizing that there were many underserved communities in Malaysia, I co-founded Engineers Without Borders – Malaysia with some friends with the aim of working with these communities to bring simple and sustainable engineering solutions. Many of these projects did have an energy focus. For example, we designed, sized, and installed micro-hydro or solar-power systems for various indigenous communities, allowing them to continue living on their ancestral lands while reducing energy poverty. Many other projects incorporated other aspects of engineering, such as hydrotherapy pools for folks with special needs, and water and sanitation systems for stateless maritime communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through my work with Engineers Without Borders – Malaysia, I found a passion for the broader aspects of sustainability, development, and equity. By spending time with communities in the field and sharing in their experiences, I recognized gaps in my skill set that I could work on to be more effective in advocating for social and environmental justice. In particular, I wanted to better understand communities and their perspectives while being mindful of my positionality. In addition, I wanted to address the more systemic aspects of the problems they faced, which I felt in many cases would only be possible through a combination of research, evidence, and policy. To this end, I embarked on a PhD in environmental engineering with a minor in anthropology and pursued a Community-Based Research Fellowship with Stanford’s Haas Center for Public Service. I have also participated in the Rising Environmental Leaders Program (RELP), which helps graduate students “hone their leadership and communications skills to maximize the impact of their research.” RELP afforded me the opportunity to interact with representatives from government, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], think tanks, and industry, from which I gained a better understanding of the policy and adjacent ecosystems at both the federal and state levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What are you currently studying, and how does it relate to your past work and educational experiences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; My dissertation investigates waste management and monitoring for improved planetary health in three distinct projects. Suboptimal waste management can lead to poor outcomes, including environmental contamination, overuse of resources, and lost economic and environmental opportunities in resource recovery. My first project showed that three combinations of factors resulted in ruminant feces contaminating the stored drinking water supplies of households in rural Kenya, and the results were published in the&lt;em&gt; International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/em&gt;. Consequently, water and sanitation interventions must also consider animal waste for communities to have safe drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second project seeks to establish a circular economy in the chocolate industry with indigenous Malaysian farmers and the Chocolate Concierge, a tree-to-bar social enterprise. Having designed and optimized apparatuses and processes to create biochar from cacao husk waste, we are now examining its impact on the growth of cacao saplings and their root systems. The hope is that biochar will increase the resilience of saplings for when they are transplanted from the nursery to the farm. As biochar can improve soil health and yield while reducing fertilizer inputs and sequestering carbon, farmers can accrue substantial economic and environmental benefits, especially if they produce, use, and sell it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My third project investigates the gap in sanitation coverage worldwide and potential ways of reducing it. Globally, 46 percent of the population lacks access to safely managed sanitation, while the majority of the 54 percent who do have access use on-site sanitation facilities such as septic tanks and latrines. Given that on-site, decentralized systems typically have a lower space and resource footprint, are cheaper to build and maintain, and can be designed to suit various contexts, they could represent the best chance of reaching the sanitation Sustainable Development Goal. To this end, I am part of a team of researchers at the Criddle Group at Stanford working to develop a household-scale system as part of the Gates Reinvent the Toilet Challenge, an initiative aimed at developing new sanitation and toilet technologies for developing contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread connecting these projects is a commitment to investigating both the technical and socio-anthropological dimensions of an issue to develop sustainable, reliable, and environmentally sensitive solutions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). I believe that an interdisciplinary approach can provide a better understanding of the problem space, which will hopefully lead to effective potential solutions that can have a greater community impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you plan to do once you obtain your PhD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope to continue working in the spheres of water and sanitation and/or sustainability post-PhD. It is a fascinating moment to be in this space as a person of color from an LMIC, especially as ideas such as community-based research and decolonizing fields and institutions are becoming more widespread and acknowledged. Even during my time at Stanford, I have noticed some shifts in the discourse, although we still have a long way to go to achieve substantive and lasting change. Folks like me are underrepresented in forums where the priorities, policies, and financing of aid and development are discussed at the international or global scale. I hope I’ll be able to use my qualifications, experience, and background to advocate for more just outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Composer Elena Ruehr, a member of the MIT Music and Theater Arts faculty since 1992, premiered her new work “Requiem” at Boston’s Emmanuel Church in November 2021. Written for vocal soloists, choir, oboe, and strings, the work takes for its text a secular English translation of a Latin Mass and is dedicated to the memory of Ruehr’s mother as well as to all those who died in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Known for her vocal music and collaboration with poets, Ruehr has written four operas, four cantatas, and a number of songs. She has also written extensively for chamber ensemble, orchestra, chorus, wind ensemble, instrumental solo, opera, dance, and silent film. Her work has been described as “sumptuously scored and full of soaring melodies” (&lt;/em&gt;The New York Times&lt;em&gt;), and “unspeakably gorgeous” (&lt;/em&gt;Gramophone&lt;em&gt;). “Requiem” is one of her most deeply personal compositions. SHASS Communications asked Ruehr about her inspirations for the piece and her reflections on its performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did writing your “Requiem” in 2020, a year of great loss for your family alongside great loss on a global scale, relate to the way you think about the meaning and purpose of requiems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;My mother, Ruthann Richwine Ruehr, passed in January of 2020. She did not have Covid, but as we lived through the pandemic in March and April the two events became connected in my mind. It seemed important to pay homage to the memory of those who had died, and a requiem is one of the most noble ways I know of to do that. My husband, Seward Rutkove, who is a physician, suggested I dedicate a requiem to all who passed in 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand a requiem from the point of view of a classical music lover: There are ancient requiems from the Middle Ages, and modern requiems like Stravinsky’s “Requiem Canticles.” I am probably most moved by Mozart’s “Requiem,” which is one of the most beautiful pieces ever written, and Brahms’s “Requiem,” but there are many more. To me these great works of art are noble because they express the sorrow of loss but also celebrate the beauty of life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think when we lose someone we also stop and consider our own lives and we stop to think exactly how we live. It seems important to me, as an&amp;nbsp;artist, that we live beautifully and embrace our time as best we can. Music, for me, is a way to both experience and express time in the most cogent and precise way, and we experience time in music as an expressive and powerful event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; With all of this background in mind, how did you approach the composition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I was very aware of other requiems from great artists of the past, and I tried to tap into that tradition while still expressing something modern. The ancient aspects of my piece have to do with the way the chorus interacts with the soloists and the orchestra. The modern aspects of the piece have to do with how that music changes in a larger sense of form. For instance, the harmonic construction of the middle movement,&amp;nbsp;“Oh Have Mercy,” is based on a modern 12-tone harmonic structure. Listeners might not notice this, however — and I don’t intend them to. The idea is that a very repetitive and simple idea is spun out in a complex way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How did basing the text on a Mass help you evoke the experience you want your audience to have? And how would you describe your own experience of hearing its premiere?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike popular music, where the words and music often come together at the same time in the creative process, classical composers usually start with a previously written text and then create the music from those words. So one of the most important aspects of writing classical music that has words is that the words must be carefully chosen to convey both the meaning and sound of the music. Musical text needs to be like poetry rather than prose, for instance, as the rhythms and sounds of the words influence the musical sound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I considered many texts before deciding on an English translation of a Latin Mass. I was reluctant at first to use a Latin Mass for a few reasons. I wanted to write a requiem in English because it was my mother’s first language. And I wanted to write a secular requiem as I hoped that the music would be inclusive of people of all beliefs, including those like my mother, who was an atheist. After reading a number of English translations of simple requiem Masses, I realized that if I took out the religious words and replaced them with secular words, the Mass itself could read as a kind of map of the five stages of grief, and that these stages of grief could guide the form and emotional expression of the music, from denial and bargaining through sorrow and anger to acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turning emotions into sound is the essential nature of musical composition, a frankly magical process that I try to teach but do not completely understand. But once that map of emotional experience was clear to me, the music came as an expression of grief in a clear and immediate way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premiere performance took place during a service at Emmanuel Church. It was interesting to be part of a religious service, and I was honored to be included as I felt it gave my mother’s memorial a kind of gravitas that a simple concert would not have. During premiere performances, I often am reminded of how I felt in the moment I was composing the music. The movement “Oh Have Mercy,” for instance, has a kind of breath — the phrases move in and out in a very regular way like breathing, but in this case it is the very regular sound of a person on a ventilator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At some point about two thirds of the way through the movement, that regular rhythm breaks and there is a freeing moment. For me this is the moment of my mother’s passing. When I heard the premiere I felt for a moment as if she was with me, but also as if I could finally say goodbye. I hope that others who listen to this music will feel a similar sense of release.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Singing in the brain</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT neuroscientists have identified a population of neurons in the human brain that respond to singing but not other types of music.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, MIT neuroscientists have identified a population of neurons in the human brain that lights up when we hear singing, but not other types of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These neurons, found in the auditory cortex, appear to respond to the specific combination of voice and music, but not to either regular speech or instrumental music. Exactly what they are doing is unknown and will require more work to uncover, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The work provides evidence for relatively fine-grained segregation of function within the auditory cortex, in a way that aligns with an intuitive distinction within music,” says Sam Norman-Haignere, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Rochester Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work builds on a 2015 study in which the same research team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify a population of neurons in the brain’s auditory cortex that responds specifically to music. In the new work, the researchers used recordings of electrical activity taken at the surface of the brain, which gave them much more precise information than fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s one population of neurons that responds to singing, and then very nearby is another population of neurons that responds broadly to lots of music. At the scale of fMRI, they’re so close that you can’t disentangle them, but with intracranial recordings, we get additional resolution, and that’s what we believe allowed us to pick them apart,” says Norman-Haignere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norman-Haignere is the lead author of &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)00131-2" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;. Josh McDermott, an associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences, and Nancy Kanwisher, the Walter A. Rosenblith Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, both members of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM), are the senior authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural recordings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/neural-population-music-brain-1216"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers used fMRI to scan the brains of participants as they listened to a collection of 165 sounds, including different types of speech and music, as well as everyday sounds such as finger tapping or a dog barking. For that study, the researchers devised a novel method of analyzing the fMRI data, which allowed them to identify six neural populations with different response patterns, including the music-selective population and another population that responds selectively to speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers hoped to obtain higher-resolution data using a technique known as electrocorticography (ECoG), which allows electrical activity to be recorded by electrodes placed inside the skull. This offers a much more precise picture of electrical activity in the brain compared to fMRI, which measures blood flow in the brain as a proxy of neuron activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With most of the methods in human cognitive neuroscience, you can’t see the neural representations,” Kanwisher says. “Most of the kind of data we can collect can tell us that here’s a piece of brain that does something, but that’s pretty limited. We want to know what’s represented in there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrocorticography cannot be typically be performed in humans because it is an invasive procedure, but it is often used to monitor patients with epilepsy who are about to undergo surgery to treat their seizures. Patients are monitored over several days so that doctors can determine where their seizures are originating before operating. During that time, if patients agree, they can participate in studies that involve measuring their brain activity while performing certain tasks. For this study, the MIT team was able to gather data from 15 participants over several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those participants, the researchers played the same set of 165 sounds that they used in the earlier fMRI study. The location of each patient’s electrodes was determined by their surgeons, so some did not pick up any responses to auditory input, but many did. Using a novel statistical analysis that they developed, the researchers were able to infer the types of neural populations that produced the data that were recorded by each electrode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we applied this method to this data set, this neural response pattern popped out that only responded to singing,” Norman-Haignere says. “This was a finding we really didn’t expect, so it very much justifies the whole point of the approach, which is to reveal potentially novel things you might not think to look for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That song-specific population of neurons had very weak responses to either speech or instrumental music, and therefore is distinct from the music- and speech-selective populations identified in their 2015 study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of their study, the researchers devised a mathematical method to combine the data from the intracranial recordings with the fMRI data from their 2015 study. Because fMRI can cover a much larger portion of the brain, this allowed them to determine more precisely the locations of the neural populations that respond to singing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This way of combining ECoG and fMRI is a significant methodological advance,” McDermott says. “A lot of people have been doing ECoG over the past 10 or 15 years, but it’s always been limited by this issue of the sparsity of the recordings. Sam is really the first person who figured out how to combine the improved resolution of the electrode recordings with fMRI data to get better localization of the overall responses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song-specific hotspot that they found is located at the top of the temporal lobe, near regions that are selective for language and music. That location suggests that the song-specific population may be responding to features such as the perceived pitch, or the interaction between words and perceived pitch, before sending information to other parts of the brain for further processing, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers now hope to learn more about what aspects of singing drive the responses of these neurons. They are also working with MIT Professor Rebecca Saxe’s lab to study whether infants have music-selective areas, in hopes of learning more about when and how these brain regions develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Army Research Office, the National Science Foundation, the NSF Science and Technology Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines, the Fondazione Neurone, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Student-led MIT course provides an inside look at K-pop</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Artists and industry professionals including AleXa join the online course, offering insights into Korean pop music.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Naveen Kumar | Arts at MIT</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jeana Choi and Lisa Yoo had already bonded over their appreciation for Korean music when they decided to organize a K-pop course at MIT during the Institute's Independent Activities Period (IAP) this January. Both graduating fifth-year master's students in electrical engineering and computer science, Choi and Yoo became friends in class 21M.294 (Popular Musics of the World), where they collaborated on a podcast-style interview with a producer of Korean R&amp;amp;B.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choi, who had previously run an IAP course about &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/iap-class-four-part-harmony-0305"&gt;&lt;u&gt;classical music&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, came to Yoo with the idea of creating a class around K-pop, short for Korean pop music, which has grown into a global phenomenon in recent years. “We didn’t know what would be possible, so we were really reaching for the stars,” Yoo says of contacting potential guests to participate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting course, “Achieving the Unthinkable: K-Pop on the Global Stage,” brought together a starry and diverse roster of international guest artists, including performers, producers, choreographers, and more, offering participants a wide array of insider perspectives on the massive industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choi and Yoo are both Korean-American and grew up with a fondness for K-pop, so watching it develop a global following has been especially fascinating. “We wanted to dive into K-pop from an analytical perspective, which hasn't really been done before,” Yoo says. Choi considers the opportunity to organize IAP courses as a chance to give back to the community and leave a mark. “You can really do anything if you just reach out and take the first step,” Choi says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course met twice a week for nine total sessions. “Achieving the Unthinkable” received more than 100 signups, including both live participants and those who watched recordings. Some were already K-pop fans, while others with surface-level knowledge hoped to deepen their understanding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aligning the stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both computer science majors, Choi and Yoo were roommates during the fall semester as they undertook planning for the course. Choi knew from her experience running a previous IAP course during the pandemic that the virtual format has its advantages. “You can bring in outside guests from all over the world and you don’t have to fly them out,” she recalls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers first recognized that it would be best to have English-speaking guests, as engaging a translator may add friction to the online experience. They began by contacting artists, before casting a wider net to include the many professionals who work behind the scenes. “K-pop in itself is a melting pot of different styles and concepts fused together with all these different creative minds,” Choi says. “There are so many people involved in each song.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because K-pop is also such an international industry, the flexibility of a virtual course proved especially rewarding. Guests participated from Korea, but also Sweden, Los Angeles, and Seattle. “We got a really diverse variety of perspectives on answering the question of why and how K-pop has become such a phenomenon in recent years,” Yoo says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone who said yes was super excited to talk about their experience,” Choi recalls of securing guest speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers held hourlong planning meetings over Zoom with each guest, to determine what they wanted to cover and coordinate suggested assignments. Tiffany Suh, for example, a Los Angeles-based music video producer who has worked with BTS, one of K-pop’s most famous and recognizable groups, took participants through a BTS dance break scene by scene, explaining how the video was actually shot and edited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Joseph, a choreographer and creative director, also led students through a scene from a BTS video, but from the perspective of the group’s dance maneuvers, breaking down what makes the movement so dynamic and complex. Advanced planning of logistics, and going over what material guests would cover, made for an immersive and detailed experience, Choi says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other guests included AleXa, a K-pop artist and idol based in Korea; Swedish songwriting duos Moonshine and Caesar &amp;amp; Loui; L.A.-based songwriter Chikk; A&amp;amp;R executive Michelle Cho; solo artist Benji; and creative director DPR REM. Lauren Dickel from MIT's Music and Theater Arts Section assisted the organizers with artist logistics, while Madeline Wang helped moderate the conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each session concluded with Q&amp;amp;A between the artists and participants, a 20-minute period that usually ran overtime. “The highlight has definitely been the interactions between the MIT community and the artists,” Choi says. Course participants were very engaged, Choi says, and “the guests appreciated speaking to eager young minds.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course speakers helped illuminate why and how K-pop has grown so rapidly in popularity in recent years. Chikk noted that K-pop started achieving crossover success when the group collaborated with U.S. pop artists, like Nicki Minaj and Selena Gomez, and made an English-language album. Suh, the music video producer, highlighted how technology has accelerated the rise of K-pop, with YouTube allowing groups to cultivate global audiences. And Benji broke down the industry’s now tried-and-true formula for developing a successful K-pop act, from training and development to marketing and promotion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All the different insights from our guests have helped participants develop a deeper appreciation for where the music comes from, which has been so great,” Yoo adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong music lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Choi and Yoo cultivated a love of music from a young age, and will undoubtedly carry that enthusiasm beyond MIT. Choi grew up in the Boston area, playing violin from age 5 and attending performances around town, before minoring in music at MIT and playing in the Chamber Music Society. Yoo, who hails from Ithaca, New York, grew up playing piano and clarinet, and joined the Wind Ensemble and also played in Chamber Music Society while at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My music and arts experience overall at MIT has been super positive, and definitely contributed to how we ended up organizing the IAP,” Yoo says. “It’s been super rewarding giving back to people, since both of us have been involved in the music community here at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of curiosity and possibility that led Choi and Yoo to organize “Achieving the Unthinkable” will undoubtedly stay with them beyond graduation this month. “I still want to learn more about music, Yoo says, “because I'm always craving to understand more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class was supported by the Arts at MIT, Music and Theater Arts, and received funding from the Council for the Arts at MIT (CAMIT), a group of alumni and friends with a strong commitment to the arts and serving the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adedolapo Adedokun has a lot to look forward to in 2023. After completing his degree in electrical engineering and computer science next spring, he will travel to Ireland to undertake an MS in intelligent systems at Trinity College Dublin as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/adedolapo-adedokun-mitchell-scholar-1122"&gt;MIT’s fourth student to receive the prestigious George J. Mitchell Scholarship&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;But there’s more to Adedokun, who goes by Dolapo, than just academic achievement. Besides being a talented computer scientist, the senior is an accomplished musician, an influential member of student government &lt;/em&gt;— &lt;em&gt;and an anime fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What excites you the most about going to Ireland to study for a year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the reasons I was interested in Ireland was when I learned about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.musicgeneration.ie/"&gt;Music Generation&lt;/a&gt;, a national music education initiative in Ireland, with the goal of giving every child in Ireland access to the arts through access to music tuition, performance opportunities, and music education in and outside of the classroom. It made me think, “Wow, this is a country that recognizes the importance of arts and music education and has invested to make it accessible for people of all backgrounds.” I am inspired by this initiative and wish it was something I could have had growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also really inspired by the work of Louis Stewart, an amazing jazz guitarist who was born and raised in Dublin. I am excited to explore his musical influences and to dive into the rich musical community of Dublin. I hope to join a jazz band, maybe a trio or a quartet, and perform all around the city, immersing myself in the rich Irish musical scene, but also sharing my own styles and musical influences with the community there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Of course, while you’re there, you’ll be working on your MS in intelligent systems. I’m intrigued by your invention of a smart-home system that lets users layer different melodies as they enter and leave a building. Can you tell us a little more about that system: how it works, how you envision users interacting with it and experiencing it, and what you learned from developing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Funny enough, it actually started as a system I worked on in my freshman year in 6.08 (Introduction to Embedded Systems) with a few classmates. We called it Smart HOMiE, an IoT [internet-of-things] Arduino smart-home device that gathered basic information like location, weather, and interfaced with Amazon Alexa. I had forgotten about having worked on it until I took 21M.080 (Introduction to Music Technology) and 6.033 (Computer System Engineering) in my junior year, and began to learn about the creative applications of machine learning and computer science in areas like audio synthesis and digital instrument design. I learned about amazing projects like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sites.research.google/tonetransfer"&gt;Google Magenta’s Tone Transfer ML&lt;/a&gt; — models that use machine learning models to transform sounds into legitimate musical instruments. Learning about this unique intersection combining music and technology, I began to think about bigger questions, like, “What kind of creative future can technology create? How can technology enable anyone to be expressive?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I had some downtime while being at home for a year, I wanted to play around with some of the audio synthesis tools I had learned about. I took Smart HOMiE and upgraded it a bit — made it a bit more musical. It worked in three main steps. First, multiple people could sing and record melodies that the device would save and store. Then, using a few pitch correction and audio synthesis Python libraries, Smart HOMiE corrected the recorded melodies until they fit together, or generally fit inside the same key, in music terms. Lastly, it then would combine the melodies, add some harmony or layer the track over a backing track, and by the end, you’ve made something really unique and expressive. It was definitely a bit scrappy, but it was one of my first times messing around and exploring all the work that has already been done by amazing people in this space. Technology has this incredible potential to make anyone a creator — I’d like to build the tools to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re a jazz instrumentalist yourself. Tell us more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve always had an affinity for music, but haven’t always felt like I could become a musician. I had played saxophone in middle school but it never really stuck. When I got to MIT, I was fortunate enough to take 21M.051 (Fundamentals of Music) and dive into proper music theory for the first time. It was in that class that I was exposed to jazz and completely fell in love. I’ll never forget walking back to New House from Barker Library in my freshman year and stumbling upon&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3b2s2A8DPISbaQNxhrEsGQ?autoplay=true"&gt;“Undercurrent,” by Bill Evans and Jim Hall&lt;/a&gt; — I think that was when I decided I wanted to learn jazz guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz, and in particular improvisation, has taught me so much about what it means to be creative: to be willing to experiment, take risks, build upon the work of others, and accept failure — all skills that I wholeheartedly believe have made me a better technologist and leader. Most importantly, though, I think music and jazz have taught me patience and discipline, and that mastery of a skill takes a lifetime. I’d be lying if I said I was satisfied with where I am currently at, but each day, I’m eager to take one step forward towards my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You’ve focused in on music and arts education, and the potential of technology to bolster both. Is there a particularly influential class, technology, or teacher in your past that you can point to as a change-maker in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Wow, tough question! I think there are a few inflection points that have really been change-makers for me. The first was in high school when I first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/harmonix-music-gameplay-1214"&gt;learned about Guitar Hero&lt;/a&gt;, the music rhythm video game that started as a project in the MIT Media Lab attempting to bring the joy of music-making to people of all backgrounds. It was then that I was able to see the multidisciplinary outreach of technology in service of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next I would say was taking 6.033 at MIT. From the first day of class, Professor [Katrina] LaCurts emphasized understanding the people we design for. That we ought to see system design as inherently people-oriented — before we think of designing a system, we must first consider the people that will be using them. We must consider their goals, their personas, their backgrounds, the barriers that they face, and most importantly, the consequences of our design and implementation choices. I envision a future where music, arts, and the creative process are accessible to everyone, and I believe 6.033 has given me the foundation to build the technology to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You’ve also developed a passion for broadband infrastructure, which at first glance, people might not connect with music and education, your other two focuses. Why is broadband such an important factor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Before we can think about the potential of technology to democratize accessibility to music and the arts, we first have to take a step back and think about accessibility. What communities have more and less access to the proper technology that we often take for granted? I think broadband is just one factor in the realm of the bigger problem, which is accessibility, particularly in minority and low-income communities. I see technology as being the key to democratizing access to music and the arts for people of all background — but that technology can only be the key if the foundational infrastructure is in place for all people to take advantage of it. Just like I learned in 6.033, that means understanding the barriers of the people and communities with the least access and investing in crucial, basic technological resources like equitable broadband internet access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Between your work on the Undergraduate Student Advisory Group in EECS, the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society, the MIT Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and of course all your research and many academic interests, many readers must wonder if you&amp;nbsp;ever&amp;nbsp;eat or sleep! How have you balanced your busy MIT life and maintained a sense of self while accomplishing so much as an undergraduate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Great question! I’ll start by saying it took me a while to figure out. There were semesters where I had to drop classes and or drop extracurricular commitments to find some sense of balance. It’s always difficult, being surrounded by the world’s brightest students who are all doing incredible and amazing things, to not feel like you should add one more class or an extra UROP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the most important thing, though, is to stay true to you — figuring out the things that bring you joy, that excite you, and how much of those commitments is reasonable to take on each semester. I’m not a student who can take a million-and-one classes, research, internships, and clubs all at the same time — but that’s totally OK. It took me a while to find the things I enjoyed, and understand the academic load that’s appropriate for me each semester, but once I did, I was happier than ever before. I realized things like playing tennis and basketball, jamming with friends, and even sneaking in a few episodes of anime here and there are really important to me. As long as I can look back each week, month, semester, and year and say I’ve taken a step forward towards my academic, social, and music goals, even just the tiniest amount, then I think I am taking steps in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Harmonix keeps innovating, with lasting impact</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2021/harmonix-music-gameplay-1214</link>
  <description><![CDATA[The MIT spinout has been releasing iconic video games for more than 25 years.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2021/harmonix-music-gameplay-1214</guid>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every holiday season, a popular new video game causes a disproportionate amount of hype, anticipation, and last-minute shopping. But few of those games offer an entirely new way to play. Even fewer have ripple effects that reach far beyond the gaming universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Guitar Hero was released in 2005, challenging players to hit notes to classic rock songs on guitar-like controllers, it grew from a holiday hit to a cultural phenomenon that taught a new generation to love rock ‘n’ roll music. Along the way, it showed the video game industry the power of innovative, music-based games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guitar Hero and the related Rock Band franchise were developed by Harmonix Music Systems, which formed more than 25 years ago in MIT’s Media Lab when a pair of friends began using technology to help people interact with music. Since then, it has released more than a dozen games that have helped millions of people experience the thrill of making music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The thing that we’ve always tried to accomplish is to innovate in music gameplay,” says Eran Egozy ’93, SM ’95, a professor of the practice in music and theater arts at MIT who co-founded the company with Alex Rigopulos ’92, SM ’94. “That’s what the company is constantly trying to do — creating new kinds of compelling music experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further that mission, Harmonix became a part of industry giant Epic Games last month. It’s a major milestone for a company that has watched its games go from small passion projects to ubiquitous sources of expression and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egozy has seen Harmonix games on famous bands’ tour buses, in the offices of tech giants like Google, at bars hosting “Rock Band nights,” and being portrayed in popular TV shows. Most importantly, he’s heard from music teachers who say the games inspired kids to play real instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, Egozy just heard from his son’s school principal that the reason he plays the drums is because of Rock Band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s probably the most gratifying part,” says Egozy, who plays the clarinet professionally. “Of course, we had great hopes and aspirations when we started the company, but we didn’t think we would actually make such a big impact. We’ve been totally surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission-driven beginnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT, Egozy majored in electrical engineering and computer science and minored in music&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; But he never thought about combining computers and music until he participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program under then-graduate student Michael Hawley in the Media Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience inspired Egozy to pursue his master’s degree at the Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, led by Tod Machover, where he began building software that generated music based on intuitive controls. He also met Rigopulos at the Media Lab, who quickly became a friend and collaborator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Alex had this idea: Wouldn’t it be cool if we took a joystick that’s a more friendly interface and used it to drive the parameters of our generative music system?” Egozy recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joystick-based system immediately became one of the most popular demos at the Media Lab, leading the pair to participate in the MIT $10K Entrepreneurship Competition (the MIT $100K today).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think MIT imbued me with a sense that there’s no point in trying to do something that someone’s already done,” Egozy says. “If you’re going to work on something, try to do something inventive. That’s a pervasive attitude all around MIT, not just at the Media Lab.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As graduation arrived, Egozy and Rigopulos knew they wanted to continue working on the system, but they doubted they could find a company that would pay them to do it. Out of that simple logic, Harmonix was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders spent the next four years working on the technology, which led to a product called Axe that Egozy describes as a “total flop.” They also built a system for Disney at the Epcot amusement park and tried to integrate their software with karaoke machines in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We sustained multiple failures trying to figure out what our business was, and it took us quite a while to discover the way to satisfy our mission, which is to let everyone in the world experience the joy of making music. As it turns out, that was through video games,” Egozy says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s first several video games were not huge hits, but by iterating on the core platform, Harmonix was able to steadily improve on the design and gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, when it came time to make Guitar Hero around 2005, the founders had music, graphics, and design systems they knew could work with unique controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egozy describes Guitar Hero as a relatively low-budget project within Harmonix. The company had two games in development at the time, and the Guitar Hero team was the smaller one. It was also a quick turnaround: They finished Guitar Hero in about nine months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through its other releases, the Harmonix team had been trained to expect most of its sales to come in the weeks leading up to the Christmas holiday and then for sales to essentially stop. With Guitar Hero, the game sold incredibly quickly — so quickly that retailers immediately wanted more, and the company making the guitar controllers had to multiply their orders with manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what really surprised the founders was that January’s sales surpassed December’s. … Then February’s surpassed January’s. In fact, month after month, the sales graph looked like nothing Harmonix’s team of 45 people had ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was mostly shock and disbelief within Harmonix,” Egozy says. “We just adored making Guitar Hero. It was the game we always wanted to make. Everyone at Harmonix was somehow involved in music. The company had a band room just so people could go and jam. And so the fact that it also sold really well was extremely gratifying — and very unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things moved quickly for Harmonix after that. Work on Guitar Hero 2 began immediately. Guitar Hero got taken over by Activision, and Harmonix was acquired by MTV Networks for a number of years. Harmonix went on to develop the Rock Band franchise, which brought players together to perform the lead guitar, bass, keyboard, drums, and vocals of popular songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was really wonderful because it was about a group effort,” Egozy says. “Rock Band was social in the sense that everyone’s together in the same room playing music together, not competitively, but working toward a common goal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ongoing legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, Harmonix has continued to explore new modes of music gameplay with releases such as SingSpace, which offers a social karaoke experience, and Fuser, a DJ-inspired game that lets users mix and match different tracks. The company also released Rock Band VR, which makes players feel like they’re on stage in front of a live audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days Egozy, who’s been on the board since he became a full-time professor at MIT in 2014, teaches 21M.385/6.185 (Interactive Music Systems), a class that combines computer science, interaction design, and music. “It’s the class I wish I had as an undergrad here at MIT,” Egozy says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And every semester, the class takes a tour of the Harmonix office. He’s often told it’s students’ favorite part of class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I'm really proud of what we were able to do, and I’m still surprised and humbled by the cultural impact we had,” Egozy says. “There is a generation of kids that grew up playing these games that learned about all this music from the ’70s and ’80s. I’m really happy we were able to expose kids to all that great music.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Scientists and musicians tackle climate change together</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2021/scientists-musicians-climate-change-1201</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Discussion at MIT explores ways the music industry can help in the battle to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 11:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2021/scientists-musicians-climate-change-1201</guid>
        <dc:creator>David L. Chandler | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Audiences may travel long distances to see their favorite musical acts in concert or to attend large music festivals, which can add to their personal carbon footprint of emissions that are steadily warming the planet. But these same audiences, and the performers they follow, are often quite aware of the dangers of climate change and eager to contribute to ways of curbing those emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should the industry reconcile these two perspectives, and how should it harness the enormous influence that musicians have on their fans to help promote action on climate change?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the focus of a wide-ranging discussion on Monday hosted by MIT’s Environmental Solutions Initiative, titled “Artists and scientists together on climate solutions.” The event, which was held live at the Media Lab’s Bartos Theater and streamed online, featured John Fernandez, director of ESI; Dava Newman, director of the Media Lab; Tony McGuinness, a musician with the group Above and Beyond; and Anna Johnson, the sustainability and environment officer at Involved Group, an organization dedicated to embedding sustainability in business operations in the arts and culture fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fernandez pointed out in opening the discussion that when it comes to influencing people’s attitudes and behavior, changes tend to come about not just through information from a particular field, but rather from a whole culture. “We started thinking about how we might work with artists, how to have scientists and engineers, inventors, and designers working with artists on the challenges that we really need to face,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with the climate change issue, he said, “is not about 2050 or 2100. This is about 2030. This is about this decade. This is about the next two or three years, really shifting that curve” to lowering the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. “It's not going to be done just with science and engineering,” he added. “It's got to be done with artists and business and everyone else. It's not only ‘all of the above’ solutions, it's ‘all of the above’ people, coming together to solve this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newman, who is also a professor in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and has served as a NASA deputy administrator, said that while scientists and engineers can produce vast amounts of useful data that clearly demonstrate the dramatic changes the Earth’s climate is undergoing, communicating that information effectively is often a challenge for these specialists. “That data is just the data, but that doesn't change the hearts and minds,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As scientists, having the data from our satellites, looking down, but also flying airplanes into the atmosphere, … we have the sensors, and then what can we do with it all? … How do we change human behavior? That's the part I don't know how to do,” Newman said. “I can have the technology, I can get precision measurements, I can study it, but really at the end of the day, we have to change human behavior, and that is so hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where the world of art and music can play a part, she said. “The best way that I know how to do it is with artistic experiences. You can have one moving experience and when you wake up tomorrow, maybe you're going to do something a little different.” To help generate the compassion and empathy needed to affect behavior positively, she said, “that’s where we turn to the storytellers. We turn to the visionaries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGuinness, whose electronic music trio has performed for millions of people around the world, said that his own awareness of the urgency of the climate issue came from his passion for scuba diving, and the dramatic changes he has seen over the last two decades. In diving at a coral reef off Palau in the South Pacific, he returned to what had been a lush, brightly colored ecosystem, and found that “immediately when you put your face under the water, you're looking at the surface of the moon. It was a horrible shock to see this.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this and other similar diving experiences, he said, “I just came away shocked and stunned,” and realizing the kinds of underwater experiences he had enjoyed would no longer exist for his children. After reading more on the subject of global warming, &amp;nbsp;“that really sort of tipped me over the edge. And I was like, this is probably the most important thing for living beings now. And that's sort of where I've remained ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While his group Above and Beyond has performed one song specifically related to global warming, he doesn’t expect that to be the most impactful way of using their influence. Rather, they’re trying to lead by example, he said, by paying more attention to everything from the supply chains of the merchandise sold at concerts to the emissions generated by travel to the concerts. They’re also being selective about concert venues and making an effort to find performance spaces that are making a significant effort to curb their emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If people start voting with their wallets,” McGuinness said, “and there are companies that are doing better than others and are doing the right thing, maybe it’ll catch on. I guess that’s what we can hope for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding these kinds of issues, involving supply chains, transportation, and facilities associated within the music industry, has been the focus of much of Johnson’s work, through the organization Involved Group, which has entered into a collaboration with MIT through the Environmental Solutions Initiative. “It's these kinds of novel partnerships that have so much potential to catalyze the change that we need to see at an incredible pace,” she said. Already, her group has worked with MIT on mapping out where emissions occur throughout the various aspects of the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a recent music festival in London, she said, the group interviewed hundreds of participants, including audience members, band members, and the crew. “We explored people's level of awareness of the issues around climate change and environmental degradation,” she said. “And what was really interesting was that there was clearly a lot of awareness of the issue across those different stakeholders, and what felt like a real, genuine level of concern and also of motivation, to want to deepen their understanding of what their contribution on a personal level really meant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together across the boundaries of different disciplines and areas of expertise could be crucial to winning the battle against global warming, Newman said. “That’s usually how breakthroughs work,” she said. “If we’re really looking to have impact, it’s going to be from teams of people who are trained across the disciplines.” She pointed out that 90 percent of MIT students are also musicians: “It does go together!” she said. “I think going forward, we have to create new academia, new opportunities that are truly multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT senior Adedolapo “Dolapo” Adedokun has been named one of 12 winners of the George J. Mitchell Scholarship’s Class of 2023. After completing his degree in electrical engineering and computer science next spring, he will travel to Ireland to undertake a MSc in intelligent systems at Trinity College Dublin as MIT’s fourth student to receive this award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell Scholars are selected on the basis of academic achievement, leadership, and dedication to public service. The scholarship is named in honor of U.S. Senator Mitchell’s contributions to the Northern Ireland peace process. This year, over 350 American students were endorsed to apply for the prestigious fellowship, which is sponsored by the U.S.-Ireland Alliance and funds a year of graduate studies in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adedokun was raised in East Brunswick, New Jersey, and is the son of Nigerian immigrants. His goal is to become a technologist who builds platforms for artistic expression that can be used to democratize musical education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adedokun was supported in the application process by MIT’s Distinguished Fellowships team in Career Advising and Professional Development, and the Presidential Committee on Distinguished Fellowships. Mark Brennan PhD ’20, a member of the Presidential Committee for Distinguished Fellowships, says, “Dolapo is at the frontier of ensuring equitable access to arts education, one of the most important yet unevenly available aspects of the American school system. With a passion for jazz and extensive commercial technology development experience, he has all the pieces in place to spur technology-supported arts education in American schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a computer scientist and jazz instrumentalist, Adedokun wants to use the power of technology and music to foster connections between people, enabling all communities to have a voice in expressing themselves artistically. He is also motivated by his observations of the inequities of broadband access, particularly for communities of color, and wishes to contribute to innovations in this arena to ensure that all students, regardless of their backgrounds or circumstances, have access to internet infrastructure to achieve educationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was after taking both 6.033 (Computer System Engineering) and 21M.080 (Music Technology) that Adedokun was inspired to invent a smart-home system that allowed users to anonymously layer different melodies as they entered and left a building, which created a unique and rich soundtrack for each day. Adedokun wants to develop in tandem his talents in music and computer science, perhaps by using the field of network latency to allow musical collaboration that defies the limitations of geographic boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adedokun has brought his passion for leadership to many MIT organizations. In his sophomore year, Adedokun was elected president of the MIT Chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, spearheading an initiative to create 10 new corporate relationships to increase minority participation in STEM fields and the technology industry. Within his computer science department, he was one of 10 students selected for the Undergraduate Student Advisory Group in EECS (USAGE). Subjects that Adedokun has tackled include advising on the structure of introductory courses, promoting new AI curricula and pre-orientation program for incoming first-year students, and improving teaching assistant training. Adedokun serves on the board of directors for the Harvard/MIT Cooperative Society, America’s oldest college cooperative. Adedokun credits his membership in Chocolate City, an MIT living group, as a force to ground him and provide him the pivotal support he needed at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
