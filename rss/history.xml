  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For as long as people have been communicating through writing, they have found ways to keep their messages private. Before the invention of the gummed envelope in 1830, securing correspondence involved letterlocking, an ingenious process of folding a flat sheet of paper to become its own envelope, often using a combination of folds, tucks, slits, or adhesives such as sealing wax. Letter writers from Erasmus to Catherine de’ Medici to Emily Dickinson employed these techniques, which Jana Dambrogio, the MIT Libraries’ Thomas F. Peterson (1957) Conservator, has named “letterlocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The study of letterlocking very consciously bridges humanities and sciences,” says Dambrogio, who first became interested in the practice as a fellow in the conservation studio of the Vatican Apostolic Archives, where she discovered examples from the 15th and 16th centuries. “It draws on the perspectives of not only conservators and historians, but also engineers, imaging experts, and scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now the rich history of this centuries-old document security technology is the subject of a new book,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049276/letterlocking/"&gt;Letterlocking: The Hidden History of the Letter&lt;/a&gt;,” published by the MIT Press and co-authored with Daniel Starza Smith, a lecturer in early modern English literature at King’s College London. Dambrogio and Smith have pioneered the field of letterlocking research over the last 10 years, working with an international and interdisciplinary collection of experts, the Unlocking History Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With more than 300 images and diagrams, “Letterlocking” explores the practice’s history through real examples from all over the world. It includes a dictionary of 60 technical terms and concepts, systems the authors developed while studying more than 250,000 historic letters. The book aims to be a springboard for new discoveries, whether providing a new lens on history or spurring technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In working with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/mit-libraries-explore-17th-century-postal-archive-signed-sealed-undelivered-1110"&gt;Brienne Collection&lt;/a&gt; — a 17th-century postal trunk full of undelivered letters — the Unlocking History Research Group sought to study intact examples of locked letters without destroying them in the process. This stimulated advances in conservation, radiology, and computational algorithms. In 2020, the team collaborated with researchers from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Amanda Ghassaei SM ’17, and Holly Jackson ’22, to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/researchers-virtually-open-sealed-historic-letters-0302"&gt;develop new algorithms&lt;/a&gt; that could virtually read an unopened letter, publishing the results in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Letterlocking” also offers a comprehensive guide to making one’s own locked letters. “The best introduction to letterlocking is to make some models,” says Dambrogio. “Feel the shape and the weight; see how easy it would be to conceal or hard to open without being noticed. We’re inviting people to explore and expand this new field of study through ‘mind and hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2025&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/by-subject"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; World University Ranking&lt;/a&gt; has ranked MIT first in three subject categories: Arts and Humanities, Business and Economics, and Social Sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Times Higher Education World University Ranking is an annual publication of university rankings by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, a leading British education magazine. The subject rankings are based on 18 rigorous performance indicators. Criteria include teaching, research environment, research volume and influence, industry, and international outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Disciplines included in the 2025 top-ranked subjects are housed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS), the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sap.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Architecture and Planning&lt;/a&gt; (SA+P), and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The rankings are a testament to the extraordinary quality of the research and teaching that takes place in SHASS and across MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;Agustín Rayo, Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS and professor of philosophy. “There has never been a more important time to ensure that we train students who understand the social, economic, political, and human aspects of the great challenges of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/arts-and-humanities?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Arts and Humanities ranking&lt;/a&gt; evaluated 750 universities from 72 countries in the disciplines of languages, literature, and linguistics; history, philosophy, and theology; architecture; archaeology; and art, performing arts, and design. This marks the first time MIT has earned the top spot in this subject since &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; began publishing rankings in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The ranking for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/business-and-economics?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Business and Economics&lt;/a&gt; evaluated 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories across three core disciplines: business and management; accounting and finance; and, economics and econometrics. This is the fourth consecutive year MIT has been ranked first in this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/social-sciences?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; ranking evaluated 1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories in the disciplines of political science and international studies; sociology, geography, communication and media studies; and anthropology. The areas under evaluation include political science and international relations; sociology; geography; communication and media studies; and anthropology. MIT claimed the top spot alone in this subject, after tying for first in 2024 with Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other subjects, MIT was also named among the top universities, ranking third in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/computer-science"&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/engineering"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/life-sciences"&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, and fourth in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/physical-sciences"&gt;Physical Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, MIT ranked second in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/latest/world-ranking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; 2025 World University Ranking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>An “All-American” vision of service to others</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Former NFL linebacker Spencer Paysinger keynotes the 51st annual MLK Celebration, with a message focused on building community.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spencer Paysinger has already been many things in his life, including a Super Bowl-winning linebacker, a writer and producer of the hit television series “All-American,” and local-business entrepreneur. But as he explained during his keynote speech at MIT’s 51st annual event celebrating the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., Paysinger would prefer to think about his journey in additional terms: whether he has been able to serve others along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I stand up here today talking about Dr. King’s mission, Dr. King’s dream, why we’re all here today, to me it all leans back into community,” Paysinger said. “I want to be judged by what I have done for others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reach out to others, in good times and bad, was a theme of the annual event, which took place in MIT’s Walker Memorial (Building 50), on Thursday. As Paysinger noted, his own career is marked by being a “team player” and finding reward in shared endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, I’m at my best when I have people on the right and on the left of me attempting to reach the same dream,” Paysinger said. “We can have different ideologies, we can come from different backgrounds, of race, socioeconomic backgrounds. … At the end of the day it comes back to the mindset we need to have. It’s rooted in community, it’s rooted in togetherness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event featured an array of talks delivered by students, campus leaders, and guests, along with musical interludes, and drew hundreds from the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In opening remarks, MIT President Sally A. Kornbluth praised Paysinger, saying his “perseverance and tenacity are a fantastic example to us all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kornbluth also spoke about the values, and value, of MIT itself. American universities and colleges, she noted, have long “been a point of national pride and a source of international envy. … They and we have always been valued as centers of excellence creativity, innovation, and an infinitely renewable source of leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Kornbluth noted, the MIT community will continue to pursue excellence and provide mutual respect for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is in the talent business,” Kornbluth said. “Our success, and living up to our great mission, depends on our ability to attract extraordinarily talented people and to create a community in which everyone earns a place here to do their very best work. … Everyone at MIT is here because they deserve to be here. Every staff member, every faculty member, every postdoc, every student, every one of us. Every one of us is a full member of this community, and every member of our community is valued as a human being, and valued for what they contribute to our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paysinger lauded the array of speakers as well as the friendly atmosphere at the event, where attendees sat around luncheon tables, talking and getting to know each other before and after the slate of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You guys actively and literally in 45 minutes have changed my view of what MIT is,” Paysinger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his NFL career, Paysinger was a linebacker who played with the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, and Carolina Panthers, from 2011 through 2017, appearing in 94 regular-season games and five playoff games. He saw action in Super Bowl XLVI, when the Giants beat the New England Patriots, 22-17, something he joked about a few times for his Massachusetts audience. Paysinger’s former New York Giants teammate, fellow linebacker Mark Herzlich, was also in attendance on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paysinger grew up in South Central Los Angeles, long perceived from the outside as a place of danger and deprivation. And while he experienced those things, Paysinger said, his home neighborhood also had its “all-American” side, as kids raced bikes down the block and grew to know each other. Paysinger attended Beverly Hills High School, starring as a wide receiver, then signed with the University of Oregon, where he converted to linebacker. Oregon and Paysinger reached college football’s national championship game in his senior season, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Paysinger emphasized the twists and turns of his journey through football, from changing positions on the field to changing teams. He noted that, in sports as in life, moving beyond our comfort zone can help us thrive in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was scared, I wasn’t sure of myself, when my coaches decided to make that change for me,” Paysinger said. However, he added, “I knew that [from] leaning into the uncomfortableness of the moment, the other side could be greater for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL soon beckoned, along with a Super Bowl ring. But Paysinger received a jolt beyond the boundaries of sports in 2015, when his former Giants teammate and close friend Tyler Sash died suddently at age 27. Among other things, Paysinger began thinking about life after football more systematically and began his screenwriting efforts in earnest, even as his football career was still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All-American,” now entering its 7th season on the CW Network, is loosely based on his own background, capturing the dynamics of his experiences as a player and team member. It has become one of the longest-running sports-based shows on television. Paysinger is also an entrepreneur who founded Hilltop Kitchen and Coffee, a chain of eateries in underserved areas around Los Angeles, and has helped develop other local businesses as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while every new venture is a fresh challenge, Paysinger said, we can often accomplish more than we realize: “I’m not coming from a mindset of deciding whether I can or can’t do something, but if I want to or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Michael Ewing provided welcoming remarks and introduced Paysinger. He read aloud a quote from King chosen as a central motif of this year’s celebration: “We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his own part, Ewing said, “When I read these words, I think of a society that aspires to improve its circumstances, address existing issues, and create a more positive and just environment for all.” At MIT, Ewing added, there is “a community where students, professors, and others come together to achieve at the highest levels, united by a shared desire to learn and grow. … The process of collaborating, disagreeing, building with others who are different — this is the key to growth and development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual MLK Celebration featured further reflections from students, including second-year undergraduate Siddhu Pachipala, a political science and economics double-major. Pachipala began his remarks by recounting a social media exchange he once had with a congressional account, the tenor of which he soon regretted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, I think it was a missed opportunity,” Pachipala said. “Why was my first instinct … to turn it into a battle? … We train ourselves to believe that if we’re not scoring hits, we’re losing, and gestures of decency are traps, that an extended hand must be slapped away. Martin Luther King Jr. took politics to be something more substantial. He had a serious vision of justice, one we’ve gathered today to honor. But he knew that justice had a prerequisite: friendship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elshareef Kabbashi, a graduate student in architecture, offered additional remarks, noting that “Dr. King’s dream was never confined to a single movement, nation, or moment in history,” but rather aimed at creating “human dignity everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E. Denise Simmons, mayor of the City of Cambridge, also spoke, and lauded “the entire MIT community for keeping this tradition alive for 51 years.” She added: “It’s Dr. King’s wisdom, his courage, his moral clarity, that helped light the path forward. And I ask each of you to continue to shine that light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The luncheon included the presentation of the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Awards Recipients, given this year to Cordelia Price ’78, SM ’80; Pouya Alimagham; Ciarra Ortiz; Sahal Ahmed; William Gibbs; and Maxine Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a day full of thoughts about King and his vision, Paysinger underscored the salience of community by highlighting another of his favorite King passages: “Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. This is the judgment. Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For all the talk about artificial intelligence upending the world, its economic effects remain uncertain. There is massive investment in AI but little clarity about what it will produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining AI has become a significant part of Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu’s work. An Institute Professor at MIT, Acemoglu has long studied the impact of technology in society, from modeling the large-scale adoption of innovations to conducting empirical studies about the impact of robots on jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Acemoglu also shared the 2024 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with two collaborators, Simon Johnson PhD ’89 of the MIT Sloan School of Management and James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for research on the relationship between political institutions and economic growth. Their work shows that democracies with robust rights sustain better growth over time than other forms of government do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of growth comes from technological innovation, the way societies use AI is of keen interest to Acemoglu, who has published a variety of papers about the economics of the technology in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where will the new tasks for humans with generative AI come from?” asks Acemoglu. “I don’t think we know those yet, and that’s what the issue is. What are the apps that are really going to change how we do things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the measurable effects of AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1947, U.S. GDP growth has averaged about 3 percent annually, with productivity growth at about 2 percent annually. Some predictions have claimed AI will double growth or at least create a higher growth trajectory than usual. By contrast, in one paper, “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/advance-article/doi/10.1093/epolic/eiae042/7728473" target="_blank"&gt;The Simple Macroeconomics of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the August issue of &lt;em&gt;Economic Policy&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu estimates that over the next decade, AI will produce a “modest increase” in GDP between 1.1 to 1.6 percent over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05 percent annual gain in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu’s assessment is based on recent estimates about how many jobs are affected by AI, including a 2023 study by researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, which finds that about 20 percent of U.S. job tasks might be exposed to AI capabilities. A 2024 study by researchers from MIT FutureTech, as well as the Productivity Institute and IBM, finds that about 23 percent of computer vision tasks that can be ultimately automated could be profitably done so within the next 10 years. Still more research suggests the average cost savings from AI is about 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to productivity, “I don’t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years. That’s better than zero,” Acemoglu says. “But it’s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and in tech journalism are making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is an estimate, and additional AI applications may emerge: As Acemoglu writes in the paper, his calculation does not include the use of AI to predict the shapes of proteins — for which other scholars subsequently shared a Nobel Prize in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other observers have suggested that “reallocations” of workers displaced by AI will create additional growth and productivity, beyond Acemoglu’s estimate, though he does not think this will matter much. “Reallocations, starting from the actual allocation that we have, typically generate only small benefits,” Acemoglu says. “The direct benefits are the big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I tried to write the paper in a very transparent way, saying what is included and what is not included. People can disagree by saying either the things I have excluded are a big deal or the numbers for the things included are too modest, and that’s completely fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which jobs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting such estimates can sharpen our intuitions about AI. Plenty of forecasts about AI have described it as revolutionary; other analyses are more circumspect. Acemoglu’s work helps us grasp on what scale we might expect changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go out to 2030,” Acemoglu says. “How different do you think the U.S. economy is going to be because of AI? You could be a complete AI optimist and think that millions of people would have lost their jobs because of chatbots, or perhaps that some people have become super-productive workers because with AI they can do 10 times as many things as they’ve done before. I don’t think so. I think most companies are going to be doing more or less the same things. A few occupations will be impacted, but we’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is right, then AI most likely applies to a bounded set of white-collar tasks, where large amounts of computational power can process a lot of inputs faster than humans can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, et cetera,” Acemoglu adds. “And those are essentially about 5 percent of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Acemoglu and Johnson have sometimes been regarded as skeptics of AI, they view themselves as realists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying not to be bearish,” Acemoglu says. “There are things generative AI can do, and I believe that, genuinely.” However, he adds, “I believe there are ways we could use generative AI better and get bigger gains, but I don’t see them as the focus area of the industry at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine usefulness, or worker replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Acemoglu says we could be using AI better, he has something specific in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his crucial concerns about AI is whether it will take the form of “machine usefulness,” helping workers gain productivity, or whether it will be aimed at mimicking general intelligence in an effort to replace human jobs. It is the difference between, say, providing new information to a biotechnologist versus replacing a customer service worker with automated call-center technology. So far, he believes, firms have been focused on the latter type of case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My argument is that we currently have the wrong direction for AI,” Acemoglu says. “We’re using it too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Johnson delve into this issue in depth in their high-profile 2023 book “Power and Progress” (PublicAffairs), which has a straightforward&amp;nbsp;leading question: Technology creates economic growth, but who captures that economic growth? Is it elites, or do workers share in the gains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Acemoglu and Johnson make abundantly clear, they favor technological innovations that increase worker productivity while keeping people employed, which should sustain growth better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But generative AI, in Acemoglu’s view, focuses on mimicking whole people. This yields something he has for years been calling “so-so technology,” applications that perform at best only a little better than humans, but save companies money. Call-center automation is not always more productive than people; it just costs firms less than workers do. AI applications that complement workers seem generally on the back burner of the big tech players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think complementary uses of AI will miraculously appear by themselves unless the industry devotes significant energy and time to them,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does history suggest about AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that technologies are often designed to replace workers is the focus of another recent paper by Acemoglu and Johnson, “&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091823-025129" target="_blank"&gt;Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution — and in the Age of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in August in &lt;em&gt;Annual Reviews in Economics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article addresses current debates over AI, especially claims that even if technology replaces workers, the ensuing growth will almost inevitably benefit society widely over time. England during the Industrial Revolution is sometimes cited as a case in point. But Acemoglu and Johnson contend that spreading the benefits of technology does not happen easily. In 19th-century England, they assert, it occurred only after decades of social struggle and worker action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth,” Acemoglu and Johnson write in the paper. “Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. … The impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s title refers to the social historian E.P Thompson and economist David Ricardo; the latter is often regarded as the discipline’s second-most influential thinker ever, after Adam Smith. Acemoglu and Johnson assert that Ricardo’s views went through their own evolution on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David Ricardo made both his academic work and his political career by arguing that machinery was going to create this amazing set of productivity improvements, and it would be beneficial for society,” Acemoglu says. “And then at some point, he changed his mind, which shows he could be really open-minded. And he started writing about how if machinery replaced labor and didn’t do anything else, it would be bad for workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intellectual evolution, Acemoglu and Johnson contend, is telling us something meaningful today: There are not forces that inexorably guarantee broad-based benefits from technology, and we should follow the evidence about AI’s impact, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best speed for innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If technology helps generate economic growth, then fast-paced innovation might seem ideal, by delivering growth more quickly. But in another paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230353" target="_blank"&gt;Regulating Transformative Technologies&lt;/a&gt;,” from the September issue of &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu and MIT doctoral student Todd Lensman suggest an alternative outlook. If some technologies contain both benefits and drawbacks, it is best to adopt them at a more measured tempo, while those problems are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology’s productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption,” the authors write in the paper. Their model suggests that, optimally, adoption should happen more slowly at first and then accelerate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Market fundamentalism and technology fundamentalism might claim you should always go at the maximum speed for technology,” Acemoglu says. “I don’t think there’s any rule like that in economics. More deliberative thinking, especially to avoid harms and pitfalls, can be justified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those harms and pitfalls could include damage to the job market, or the rampant spread of misinformation. Or&amp;nbsp;AI might harm consumers, in areas from online advertising to online gaming. Acemoglu examines these scenarios in another paper,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230589" target="_blank"&gt;When Big Data Enables Behavioral Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;,” forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;; it is co-authored with Ali Makhdoumi of Duke University, Azarakhsh Malekian of the University of Toronto, and Asu Ozdaglar of MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are using it as a manipulative tool, or too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers, then we would want a course correction,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly others might claim innovation has less of a downside or is unpredictable enough that we should not apply any handbrakes to it. And Acemoglu and Lensman, in the September paper, are simply developing a model of innovation adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is a response to a trend of the last decade-plus, in which many technologies are hyped are inevitable and celebrated because of their disruption. By contrast, Acemoglu and Lensman are suggesting we can reasonably judge the tradeoffs involved in particular technologies and aim to spur additional discussion about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we reach the right speed for AI adoption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the idea is to adopt technologies more gradually, how would this occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, Acemoglu says, “government regulation has that role.” However, it is not clear what kinds of long-term guidelines for AI might be adopted in the U.S. or around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he adds, if the cycle of “hype” around AI diminishes, then the rush to use it “will naturally slow down.” This may well be more likely than regulation, if AI does not produce profits for firms soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason why we’re going so fast is the hype from venture capitalists and other investors, because they think we’re going to be closer to artificial general intelligence,” Acemoglu says. “I think that hype is making us invest badly in terms of the technology, and many businesses are being influenced too early, without knowing what to do. We wrote that paper to say, look, the macroeconomics of it will benefit us if we are more deliberative and understanding about what we’re doing with this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Acemoglu emphasizes, hype is a tangible aspect of the economics of AI, since it drives investment in a particular vision of AI, which influences the AI tools we may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The faster you go, and the more hype you have, that course correction becomes less likely,” Acemoglu says. “It’s very difficult, if you’re driving 200 miles an hour, to make a 180-degree turn.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migrants have become a flashpoint in global politics. But new research by an MIT political scientist, focused on West Germany and Poland after World War II, shows that in the long term, those countries developed stronger states, more prosperous economies, and more entrepreneurship after receiving a large influx of immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings come from a close examination, at the local level over many decades, of&amp;nbsp;the communities receiving migrants as millions of people relocated westward when Europe’s postwar borders were redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found that places experiencing large-scale displacement [immigration] wound up accumulating state capacity, versus places that did not,” says Volha Charnysh, the Ford Career Development Associate Professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charnysh’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uprooted/CE6B3075998AD5B1FBC44F2A3C494C6A" target="_blank"&gt;Uprooted: How Post-WWII Population Transfers Remade Europe&lt;/a&gt;,” published by Cambridge University Press, challenges the notion that migrants have a negative impact on receiving communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time frame of the analysis is important. Much discussion about refugees involves the short-term strains they place on institutions or the backlash they provoke in local communities. Charnysh’s research does reveal tensions in the postwar communities that received large numbers of refugees. But her work, distinctively, also quantifies long-run outcomes, producing a different overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Charnysh writes in the book, “Counterintuitively, mass displacement ended up strengthening the state and improving economic performance in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracting data from history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War II wrought a colossal amount of death, destruction, and suffering, including the Holocaust, the genocide of about 6 million European Jews. The ensuing peace settlement among the Allied Powers led to large-scale population transfers. Poland saw its borders moved about 125 miles west; it was granted formerly German territory while ceding eastern territory to the Soviet Union. Its new region became 80 percent filled by new migrants,&amp;nbsp;including Poles displaced from the east and voluntary migrants from other parts of the country and from abroad. West Germany received an influx of 12.5 million Germans displaced from Poland and other parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of these population transfers, Charnysh used historical records to create four original quantitative datasets at the municipal and county level, while also examining archival documents, memoirs, and newspapers to better understand the texture of the time. The assignment of refugees to specific communities within Poland and West Germany amounted to&amp;nbsp;a kind of historical natural experiment, allowing her to compare how&amp;nbsp;the size and regional composition of the migrant population&amp;nbsp;affected otherwise similar areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, studying forced displacement — as opposed to the movement of a self-selected group of immigrants — meant Charnysh could rigorously examine the scaled-up effects of mass migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been an opportunity to study in a more robust way the consequences of displacement,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holocaust, followed by the redrawing of borders, expulsions, and mass relocations,&amp;nbsp;appeared to increase the homogeneity of the populations within them: In 1931 Poland consisted of about one-third ethnic minorities, whereas after the war it became almost ethnically uniform. But one insight of Charnysh’s research is that shared ethnic or national identification does not guarantee social acceptance for migrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you just rearrange ethnically homogenous populations, new cleavages emerge,” Charnysh says. “People will not necessarily see others as being the same. Those who are displaced have suffered together, have a particular status in their new place, and realize their commonalities. For the native population, migrants’ arrival increased competition for jobs, housing, and state resources, so shared identities likewise emerged, and this ethnic homogeneity didn’t automatically translate into more harmonious relations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, West Germany and Poland did assimilate these groups of immgrants into their countries. In both places, state capacity grew in the decades after the war, with the countries becoming better able to administer resources for their populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very problem, that migration and diversity can create conflict, can also create the demand for more state presence and, in cases where states are willing and able to step in,&amp;nbsp;allow for the accumulation of greater state capacity over time,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State investment in migrant-receiving localities paid off.&amp;nbsp;By the 1980s in West Germany, areas with greater postwar migration had higher levels of education, with more business enterprises being founded. That economic pattern emerged in Poland after it switched to a market economy in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needed: Property rights and liberties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Uprooted,” Charnysh also discusses the conditions in which the example of West Germany and Poland may apply to other countries. For one thing, the phenomenon of migrants bolstering the economy is likeliest to occur where states offer what the scholars Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson of MIT and James Robinson of the University of Chicago have called “inclusive institutions,” such as property rights, additional liberties, and a commitment to the rule of law. Poland, while increasing its state capacity during the Cold War, did not realize the economic benefits of migration until the Cold War ended and it changed to a more democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Charnysh observes, West Germany and Poland were granting citizenship to the migrants they received, making it easier for those migrants to assimilate and make demands on the state. “My complete account probably applies best to cases where migrants receive full citizenship rights,” she acknowledges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uprooted” has earned praise from leading scholars. David Stasavage, dean for the social sciences and a professor of politics at New York University, has called the book a “pathbreaking study” that “upends what we thought we knew about the interaction between social cohesion and state capacity.” Charnysh’s research, he adds, “shows convincingly that areas with more diverse populations after the transfers saw greater improvements in state capacity and economic performance. This is a major addition to scholarship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today there may be about 100 million displaced people around the world, including perhaps 14 million Ukrainians uprooted by war. Absorbing refugees may always be a matter of political contention. But as “Uprooted” shows, countries may realize benefits from it if they take a long-term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When states treat refugees as temporary, they don’t provide opportunities for them to contribute and assimilate,” Charnysh says. “It’s not that I don’t think cultural differences matter to people, but it’s not as big a factor as state policies.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Samurai in Japan, then engineers at MIT</title>

  <description><![CDATA[A new exhibit explores the Institute’s first Japanese students, who arrived as MIT was taking flight and their own country was opening up.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1867, five Japanese students took a long sea voyage to Massachusetts for some advanced schooling. The group included a 13-year-old named Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, who was from one of the samurai families that ruled Japan. Honma expected to become a samurai warrior himself, and enrolled in a military academy in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then some unexpected things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s ruling dynasty, the shogunate that had run the country since the 17th century, lost power. No longer obligated to become a warrior, Honma found himself free to try other things in life. In 1870, he enrolled in the recently opened Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied civil engineering. By 1874, Honma had become MIT’s first graduate from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma may have thought he was going to be a military officer, but by the time he got to MIT he wanted to do something else,” says Hiromu Nagahara, an associate professor of history at MIT. “And that something else was the hottest technology of its time: railroads.” Indeed, Honma returned to Japan and became a celebrated engineer of rail lines, including one through the mountainous Usai Pass in central Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 150 years after he graduated, Honma is a central part of an exhibit about MIT’s earliest Japanese students, “&lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/from-samurai-into-engineers/" target="_blank"&gt;From Samurai into Engineers&lt;/a&gt;,” which runs through Dec. 19 at Hayden Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit features two other early MIT graduates from Japan. Takuma Dan, Class of 1878, was also from a samurai household, studied mining engineering at MIT, and eventually became prominent in Japan as head of the Mitsui corporation. Kiyoko Makino was the first Japanese woman and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the first female international student to enroll at MIT, where she studied biology from 1903 to 1905, later becoming a teacher and textbook author in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing their lives sheds light on interesting careers — and illuminates a historical period in which MIT was reaching prominence, Japan was opening itself to the world, and modern life was rolling forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, Takuma Dan, and Kiyoko Makino, their lives fit the larger context of the relationship between America and Japan,” says Nagahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The making of “From Samurai into Engineers” was a collective effort, partly generated through MIT course 21H.155/21G.555 (Modern Japan), taught by Nagahara in the spring of 2024. Students contributed to the research and wrote short historical summaries incorporated into the exhibition. The exhibit draws on original archival materials, such as the students’ letters, theses, problem sets, and other documents. Honma’s drawings for an iron girder railroad bridge, as part of his own MIT thesis, are on display, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others on campus significantly collaborated on the project from its inception. Christine Pilcavage, managing director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-japan" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-Japan Program&lt;/a&gt;, helped encourage the development of the effort, having held an ongoing interest in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m in awe of this relationship that we’ve had since the first Japanese students were at MIT,” Pilcavage says. “We’ve had this long connection. It shows that MIT as an Institute is always innovating. Each side had much to gain, from Honma coming to MIT, learning technology, and returning to Japan, while also mentoring other students, including Dan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the research was facilitated by MIT Libraries and its Distinctive Collections holdings, which contain the archives used for the project. Amanda Hawk, who is the public services manager in the library system, worked with Nagahara to facilitate the research by the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Distinctive Collections is excited to support faculty and student projects related to MIT history, particularly those that illuminate unknown stories or underrepresented communities,” Hawk says. “It was rewarding to collaborate with Hiromu on ‘From Samurai into Engineers’ to place these students within the context of Japanese history and the development of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that MIT had students from Japan as soon as 1870 might seem improbable on both ends of this historical connection. MIT opened in 1861 but did not start offering classes until 1865. Still, it was rapidly recognized as a significant locus of technological knowledge. Meanwhile the historic changes in Japan created a small pool of students willing to travel to Massachusetts for education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The birth of MIT in the 1860s coincides with a period of huge political economic and cultural upheaval in Japan,” Nagahara says. “It was a unique moment when there was a both a desire to go overseas and a government willingness to let people go overseas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the experience of the Japanese students at MIT seems to have been fairly smooth from the start, enabling them to have a strong focus on scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma seemed to have been quite well-received,” Pilcavage says, who wonders if Honma’s social status — he was occasionally called “prince” — contributed to that. Still, she notes, “He was invited to other people’s homes on Thanksgiving. It didn’t seem like he faced extreme prejudice. The community welcomed him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Japanese students featured in the exhibit wound up leading distinctive lives. While Honma became a celebrated engineer, Dan was an even higher-profile figure. At MIT, he studied mining engineering with Robert Hollawell Richards, husband of Ellen Swallow Richards, MIT’s first female student and instructor. After starting as a mining engineer at Mitsui in 1888, by 1914 he had become chair of the board of the Mitsui conglomerate. Dan even came back to visit MIT twice as a distinguished alumnus, in 1910 and 1921.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan was also a committed internationalist, who believed in cooperation among nations, in contrast to the rising nationalism often present in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932, he was shockingly assassinated outside of Mitsui headquarters in Tokyo, a victim of nationalist terrorism. Robert Richards wrote that it was “one of those terrible things which no man in his senses can understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makino, for her part, led a much quieter life, and her status as an early student was only rediscovered in recent years by librarians working in MIT’s Distinctive Collections materials. After MIT, she returned to Japan and became a high school biology teacher in Tokyo. She also authored a textbook, “Physiology of Women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT archivists and students are continuing to research Makino’s life, and earlier this year also uncovered news articles written about her in New England newspapers while she was in the U.S. Nagahara hopes many people will continue researching MIT’s earliest Japanese students, including Sutejirō Fukuzawa, Class of 1888, the son of a well-known Japanese intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In so doing, we may gain more insight into the ways MIT, universities, and early students played concrete roles in ushering their countries into the new age. As Nagahara reflects about these students, “They’re witnessing both America and Japan become modern nation-states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Pilcavage notes, Honma’s status as a railroad builder “is symbolic. We continue to build bridges between our institution and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager living in a small village in what was then Yugoslavia, Admir Masic witnessed the collapse of his home country and the outbreak of the Bosnian war. When his childhood home was destroyed by a tank, his family was forced to flee the violence, leaving their remaining possessions to enter a refugee camp in northern Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in Croatia that Masic found what he calls his “magic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chemistry really forcefully entered my life,” recalls Masic, who is now an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “I’d leave school to go back to my refugee camp, and you could either play ping-pong or do chemistry homework, so I did a lot of homework, and I began to focus on the subject.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic has never let go of his magic. Long after chemistry led him out of Croatia, he’s come to understand that the past holds crucial lessons for building a better future. That’s why he started the MIT Refugee Action Hub (now &lt;a href="https://emergingtalent.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Emerging Talent&lt;/a&gt;) to provide educational opportunities to students displaced by war. It’s also what led him to study ancient materials, whose secrets he believes have potential to solve some of the modern world’s most pressing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re leading this concept of paleo-inspired design: that there are some ideas behind these ancient materials that are useful today,” Masic says. “We should think of these materials as a source of valuable information that we can try to translate to today. These concepts have the potential to revolutionize how we think about these materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key research focus for Masic is cement. His lab is working on ways to transform the ubiquitous material into a carbon sink, a medium for energy storage, and more. Part of that work involves studying ancient Roman concrete, whose self-healing properties he has helped to illuminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of each of Masic’s research endeavors is a desire to translate a better understanding of materials into improvements in how we make things around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Roman concrete to me is fascinating: It’s still standing after all this time and constantly repairing,” Masic says. “It’s clear there’s something special about this material, so what is it? Can we translate part of it into modern analogues? That’s what I love about MIT. We are put in a position to do cutting-edge research and then quickly translate that research into the real world. Impact for me is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic’s family fled to Croatia in 1992, just as he was set to begin high school. Despite excellent grades, Masic was told Bosnian refugees couldn't enroll in the local school. It was only after a school psychologist advocated for Masic that he was allowed to sit in on classes as a nonmatriculating student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic did his best to be a ghost in the back of classrooms, silently absorbing everything he could. But in one subject he stood out. Within six months of joining the school, in January of 1993, a teacher suggested Masic compete in a local chemistry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of the Olympiads of chemistry, and I won,” Masic recalls. “I literally floated onto the stage. It was this ‘Aha’ moment. I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’m good at chemistry!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Masic’s parents immigrated to Germany in search of a better life, but he decided to stay behind to finish high school, moving into a friend’s basement and receiving food and support from local families as well as a group of volunteers from Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just knew I had to stay,” Masic says. “With all the highs and lows of life to that point, I knew I had this talent and I had to make the most of it. I realized early on that knowledge was the one thing no one could take away from me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic continued competing in chemistry competitions — and continued winning. Eventually, after a change to a national law, the high school he was attending agreed to give him a diploma. With the help of the Italian volunteers, he moved to Italy to attend the University of Turin, where he entered a five-year joint program that earned him a master’s degree in inorganic chemistry. Masic stayed at the university for his PhD, where he studied parchment, a writing material that’s been used for centuries to record some of humanity’s most sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a classmate, Masic started a company that helped restore ancient documents. The work took him to Germany to work on a project studying the Dead Sea Scrolls, a set of manuscripts that date as far back as the third century BCE. In 2008, Masic joined the Max Planck Institute in Germany, where he also began to work with biological materials, studying water’s interaction with collagen at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through that work, Masic became an expert in Raman spectroscopy, a type of chemical imaging that uses lasers to record the vibrations of molecules without leaving a trace, which he still uses to characterize materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Raman became a tool for me to contribute in the field of biological materials and bioinspired materials,” Masic says. “At the same time, I became the ‘Raman guy.’ It was a remarkable period for me professionally, as these tools provided unparalleled information and I published a lot of papers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven years at Max Planck, Masic joined the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, I felt I could truly be myself and define the research I wanted to do,” Masic says. “Especially in CEE, I could connect my work in heritage science and this tool, Raman spectroscopy, to tackle our society’s big challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From labs to the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raman spectroscopy is a relatively new approach to studying cement, a material that contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. At MIT, Masic has explored ways cement could be &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-additives-concrete-effective-carbon-sink-0328" target="_blank"&gt;used to store carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-engineers-create-supercapacitor-ancient-materials-0731" target="_blank"&gt;act as an energy-storing supercapacitor&lt;/a&gt;. He has also &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/roman-concrete-durability-lime-casts-0106" target="_blank"&gt;solved ancient mysteries&lt;/a&gt; about the lasting strength of ancient Roman concrete, with lessons for the $400 billion cement industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really don’t think we should replace ordinary Portland cement completely, because it’s an extraordinary material that everyone knows how to work with, and industry produces so much of it. We need to introduce new functionalities into our concrete that will compensate for cement’s sustainability issues through avoided emissions,” Masic explains. “The concept we call ‘multifunctional concrete’ was inspired by our work with biological materials. Bones, for instance, sacrifice mechanical performance to be able to do things like self-healing and energy storage. That's how you should imagine construction over next 10 years or 20 years. There could be concrete columns and walls that primarily offer support but also do things like store energy and continuously repair themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic's work across academia and industry allows him to apply his multifunctional concrete research at scale. He serves as a co-director of the &lt;a href="https://eccube.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT ec&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hub&lt;/a&gt;, a principal investigator within &lt;a href="https://cshub.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub&lt;/a&gt;, and a co-founder and advisor at the technology development company &lt;a href="https://dmat.co/" target="_blank"&gt;DMAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to be at the forefront of sustainability but also to be directly interacting with key industry players that can change the world,” Masic says. “What I appreciate about MIT is how you can engage in fundamental science and engineering while also translating that work into practical applications. The CSHub and ec&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hub are great examples of this. Industry is eager for us to develop solutions that they can help support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Masic will never forget where he came from. He now lives in Somerville, Massachusetts, with his wife Emina, a fellow former refugee, and their son, Benjamin, and the family shares a deep commitment to supporting displaced and underserved communities. Seven years ago, Masic founded the MIT Refugee Action Hub (ReACT), which provides computer and data science education programs for refugees and displaced communities. Today thousands of refugees apply to the program every year, and graduates have gone on to successful careers at places like Microsoft and Meta. &amp;nbsp;To further its reach, the ReACT program was &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-emerging-talent-opens-pathways-underserved-global-learners-0425" title="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-emerging-talent-opens-pathways-underserved-global-learners-0425" data-outlook-id="149ec230-8e9c-4a55-9582-ff39fa2f81e3" target="_blank"&gt;recently absorbed&lt;/a&gt; by the Emerging Talent program at MIT Open Learning, where Masic is an executive faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a life-changing experience for them,” Masic says. “It’s an amazing opportunity for MIT to nurture talented refugees around the world through this simple certification program. The more people we can involve, the more impact we will have on the lives of these truly underserved communities.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Used to be, societies would recycle building materials. In Rome, St. Peter’s Basilica was made from the stones of the Colosseum. The Inca reused stones from one project to the next. Today we rarely do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MIT associate professor of architecture Brandon Clifford observes, we barely even admit how often we tear down buildings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The architect today designs a building with the false presumption that it’s going to last forever,” Clifford says. “Unfortunately the reality is, some buildings last the length of our mortgages, 30 years. Then they go to landfills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “If an archaeologist looks back at our time, we will be called the mound builders because we’re making enormous landfills all around the world. Those are the things that are going to last. Civilizations will ask, “What were people thinking in the early 2000s, when they were just building these colossal mounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back in time imaginatively is Clifford’s job: He studies ancient structures and building practices, to generate new ones. Recently Clifford’s studio, Matter Design, took discarded concrete chunks — from a dairy barn floor, a Motel 6 wall, and a roadbed — and used digital design and modern cutting tools to assemble them into a new wall. If the ancients could redeploy materials, why can’t we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans have been reassembling random bits of material from previous incarnations of architecture for millennia, but we just don’t understand the rules today,” says Clifford, who has also designed buildings, written a manifesto about learning from the past, and had his students build a megalithic stone and move it around Killian Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ve assembled more bits of material about Clifford himself, fitted them together, and built this profile article to last — for a while, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all architectural work contains a critique of other building forms. Clifford is upfront about this: Construction today is unsustainable, inefficient, and costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current mode of designing and subsequent construction is not working,” Clifford wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint, the architectural designs Clifford has produced — like competition entries for the Bamiyan Cultural Center in Afghanistan and the Guggenheim Helsinki — are sensitive to the supply of materials. An award-winning small project of Clifford’s, the Five Fields Play Structure in suburban Massachusetts, cleverly maximizes its square footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Clifford’s career is not really about one style of architecture. It’s about one style of architectural thinking. Today we seem surprised at the architecture of the ancients, but to Clifford, that just means we haven’t thought creatively enough about how they solved problems. Ultimately, Clifford wants to leverage the talent around him to rework our building habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our lab we find work to be successful if it challenges the way you think about the broader discipline,” says Clifford, who was granted tenure at MIT this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford’s father was an astronaut. Rich Clifford served in the military, joined NASA, and flew on three space shuttle missions in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up in Houston, surrounded by the space industry,” Clifford says. He lived down the street from astronaut John Young — one of the 12 people to walk on the moon and co-pilot of the first space shuttle flight, in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Clifford was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease before his last shuttle flight. He died in late 2021. Brandon Clifford has been reflecting about his father’s trajectory, and its influence on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work with prehistoric, gravity-laden, human contributions to Earth, while my dad was exploring space,” he says. “But we’re both exploring things, in very different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, NASA reminds Clifford of his current employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NASA is such an interesting cross-pollination of ideas,” Clifford observes. “It’s balanced between the military and public-facing images of space. The space industry has always been generating challenging ideas about humanity, while also being very scientifically rigorous. I see MIT as being on equal footing with NASA in that respect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stones and civilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford graduated from Georgia Tech in 2006, studying architecture with a focus on digital fabrication. He went to graduate school at Princeton University while the housing market crashed. “Every single one of my classmates was losing their job in architecture,” Clifford recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In graduate school, he was studying digital fabrication again. Then one day, MIT architectural historian Mark Jarzombek arrived in Princeton for a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said you can tell a civilization is doing well, if it is carving stone precisely,” Clifford says. “That moment shifted my career, and since then I have been studying stone architecture.” By the way, we don’t do much stone carving today, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford started thinking historically and globally. One common narrative is that architecture emerged out of making shelters. Yet, from Egypt to Easter Island, many societies have often advanced their building techniques for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at prehistory, the pyramids, Stonehenge, the moai of Easter Island, the polygonal masonry structure of the Inca, none of them are shelter,” Clifford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging into these structures reveals how societies maximized what they had. When the Inca recycled stone blocks into walls, they would only cut the top side, to fit each block into the new structure. The Greeks would cut the bottom side. But both were optimizing their resources and labor. Ancient practices contain useful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you don’t know can help you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, we don’t know everything about ancient buildings. To Clifford, this is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, if there are mysteries about the architecture of the past, there is room for us to think creatively about it. Given 12 hypotheses about how Stonehenge was constructed, 11 may be historically inaccurate — but several of those might contain interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My work is often misunderstood as experimental archaeology,” Clifford says. “But as an architect I’m interested in the future. I’m not trying to prove anything about the past. I’m just trying to extract bits of knowledge or find alternative ways of thinking about past construction that can change the way we think about the future. If any theory changes the way we do something, it’s still useful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a megalith move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When outsiders reached Easter Island in 1722, an obvious mystery was how the island’s gigantic statues were transported around. The islanders claimed the moai&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;had “walked” to their locations, which sounded like a fanciful myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, archaeologists Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo proposed that the Easter Island statues had been transported upright, with people using ropes to sway the statues side to side while pivoting them forward. Thus the statues could have “walked,” although not everyone immediately accepted the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford, who landed at MIT in 2012, co-taught a class with Jarzombek in 2015 that featured a group project: The students built a 16-foot megalith out of glass fiber reinforced concrete, then figured out how to transport it around Killian Court with ropes. They named it the McKnelly Megalith. The course had a teaching assistant, Carrie Lee McKnelly, whose parents had just tragically passed away, so the name was in their honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key to the McKnelly Megalith’s mobility was its curving shape. Because the center of gravity is not in the middle of the structure’s form, it is easier to pivot and swivel around. The Easter Island moai use this design principle too. The MIT class was not the first test of moving a megalith with rope — Hunt and Lipo did that in Hawaii — but it did reinforce the method’s viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the kind of thing that’s celebrated in MIT culture, honestly,” Clifford says. “Let’s make a big megalith move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And float&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Clifford and his students doubled down on megaliths, with the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/scene-at-mit-buoy-stone-0621"&gt;Buoy Stone&lt;/a&gt;, a huge, pear-shaped, fiber-reinforced piece of concrete they moored in the Charles River outside of Killian Court for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buoy Stone was built for MIT’s “&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/crossing-charles-moving-day-parade-competition-0509"&gt;Moving Day&lt;/a&gt;,” a celebration of its 100th anniversary of relocating from Boston across the rover to Cambridge. The stone was an exploration of transporting megaliths on water — as many of Stonehenge’s pieces were. In this case, the Buoy Stone was towed on water horizontally, and then when stationary, it partially filled with water and tipped upright. The object also caused a lot of local head-scratching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford again: “We had no title saying what the Buoy Stone was. With megaliths, that’s part of the mystery: Why is that thing here? A giant stone miles from the nearest quarry is an intriguing artifact. People in Cambridge still tell me, ‘I run along the Charles River and I used to wonder what that weird thing was.’ It was a fun project because it was a celebration of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buoy Stone didn’t address a historical debate as directly as the McKnelly Megalith had, but it may have contemporary applications, perhaps in barrier-type structures, and was an exercise in creative design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, the students are very open and accepting of challenging ideas,” Clifford says. “They want to think differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossus and the cosmos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford is hardly the only MIT faculty member who studies ancient building techniques; others include Jarzombek, John Ochsendorf, Admir Masic, and more. But he has settled into his own niche in the area, and is currently working on a new book project about his explorations, tentatively titled “Colossus and the Cosmos.” He has given a TED Talk and won the American Academy in Rome Prize, among other honors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be Clifford’s second book. His first was his quirky 2017 volume, “The Cannibal’s Cookbook,” with the “Cannibal” term alluding to recycling building materials, while the “Cookbook” part refers to the idea that there are recipes for doing this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there already exist advocates for “circular construction,” the greater reuse of building materials, Clifford thinks the concept needs greater circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way architecture is set up now doesn’t allow for that,” Clifford says. “We don’t have a way of reincorporating materials. Much of the reception to the first book has been from students of architecture, exploring design. I’m hoping the next layer of impact will be with the building industry, finding ways of automating this process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenure can free up professors to pursue independent-minded projects, although Clifford, for one, has never needed much encouragement in that regard. One nuance of Clifford’s career, though, is that while he has pursued his own path, it has involved a lot of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have the best colleagues I could imagine, and I think of my MIT graduate students as colleagues as well,” Clifford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I’ve never done a project on my own. I had this idea, before I started studying architecture, that an architect just sat at a drafting table and conceived of buildings, the solitary genius thing. But every project I’ve done is a collaboration with someone that knows something different. I realize there’s so much I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s that notion again, that the gaps in our knowledge are an opportunity. We will never know it all about old buildings, but even so, as Clifford notes: “The question is, ‘How much do you need to know about something to change the way you think about the future?’ That’s where the value is.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inventive solutions to some of the world’s most critical problems are being discovered in labs, classrooms, and centers across MIT every day. Many of these solutions move from the lab to the commercial world with the help of over 85 Institute resources that comprise MIT’s robust innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;amp;E) ecosystem. The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) draws on MIT’s wealth of I&amp;amp;E knowledge and experience to help researchers commercialize their breakthrough technologies through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions grant program&lt;/a&gt;. By collaborating with I&amp;amp;E programs on campus, J-WAFS prepares MIT researchers for the commercial world, where their novel innovations aim to improve productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of water and food systems, creating economic, environmental, and societal benefits along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Solutions program launched in 2015 with support from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization that advances science and learning for communities to thrive. Since 2015, J-WAFS Solutions has supported 19 projects with one-year grants of up to $150,000, with some projects receiving renewal grants for a second year of support. Solutions projects all address challenges related to water or food. Modeled after the esteemed grant program of MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and initially administered by Deshpande Center staff, the J-WAFS Solutions program follows a similar approach by supporting projects that have already completed the basic research and proof-of-concept phases.&amp;nbsp;With technologies that are one to three years away from commercialization, grantees work on identifying their potential markets and learn to focus on how their technology can meet the needs of future customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingenuity thrives at MIT, driving inventions that can be translated into real-world applications for widespread adoption, implantation, and use,” says J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “But successful commercialization of MIT technology requires engineers to focus on many challenges beyond making the technology work. MIT’s I&amp;amp;E network offers a variety of programs that help researchers develop technology readiness, investigate markets, conduct customer discovery, and initiate product design and development,” Lienhard adds.&amp;nbsp;“With this strong I&amp;amp;E framework, many J-WAFS Solutions teams have established startup companies by the completion of the grant.&amp;nbsp;J-WAFS-supported technologies have had powerful, positive effects on human welfare. Together, the J-WAFS Solutions program and MIT’s I&amp;amp;E ecosystem demonstrate how academic research can evolve into business innovations that make a better world,” Lienhard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating I&amp;amp;E collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to support for furthering research, J-WAFS Solutions grants allow faculty, students, postdocs, and research staff to learn the fundamentals of how to transform their work into commercial products and companies. As part of the grant requirements, researchers must interact with mentors through MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). VMS connects MIT entrepreneurs with teams of carefully selected professionals who provide free and confidential mentorship, guidance, and other services to help advance ideas into for-profit, for-benefit, or nonprofit ventures. Since 2000, VMS has mentored over 4,600 MIT entrepreneurs across all industries, through a dynamic and accomplished group of nearly 200 mentors who volunteer their time so that others may succeed. The mentors provide impartial and unbiased advice to members of the MIT community, including MIT alumni in the Boston area. J-WAFS Solutions teams have been guided by 21 mentors from numerous companies and nonprofits. Mentors often attend project events and progress meetings throughout the grant period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with VMS has provided me and my organization with a valuable sounding board for a range of topics, big and small,” says Eric Verploegen PhD ’08, former research engineer in the MIT D-Lab and founder of J-WAFS spinout &lt;a href="https://www.coolveg.org/"&gt;CoolVeg&lt;/a&gt;. Along with professors Leon Glicksman and Daniel Frey, Verploegen received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021 to commercialize cold-storage chambers that use evaporative cooling to help farmers preserve fruits and vegetables in rural off-grid communities. Verploegen started CoolVeg in 2022 to increase access and adoption of open-source, evaporative cooling technologies through collaborations with businesses, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies. “Working as a solo founder at my nonprofit venture, it is always great to have avenues to get feedback on communications approaches, overall strategy, and operational issues that my mentors have experience with,” Verploegen says. Three years after the initial Solutions grant, one of the VMS mentors assigned to the evaporative cooling team still acts as a mentor to Verploegen today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Solutions grant requirement is for teams to participate in the Spark program — a free, three-week course that provides an entry point for researchers to explore the potential value of their innovation. Spark is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which is an “immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transformation of invention to impact.” In 2018, MIT received an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-selected-ninth-nsf-innovation-corps-node-new-england-0904"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; from the NSF, establishing the New England Regional Innovation Corps Node (NE I-Corps) to deliver I-Corps training to participants across New England. Trainings are open to researchers, engineers, scientists, and others who want to engage in a customer discovery process for their technology. Offered regularly throughout the year, the Spark course helps participants identify markets and explore customer needs in order to understand how their technologies can be positioned competitively in their target markets. They learn to assess barriers to adoption, as well as potential regulatory issues or other challenges to commercialization. NE-I-Corps reports that since its start, over 1,200 researchers from MIT have completed the program and have gone on to launch 175 ventures, raising over $3.3 billion in funding from grants and investors, and creating over 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Katsimpouras, a research scientist in the Department of Chemical Engineering, went through the NE I-Corps Spark program to better understand the customer base for a technology he developed with&amp;nbsp;professors Gregory Stephanopoulos and Anthony Sinskey.&amp;nbsp;The group received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021&amp;nbsp;for their microbial platform that converts food waste from the dairy industry into valuable products.&amp;nbsp;“As a scientist with no prior experience in entrepreneurship, the program introduced me to important concepts and tools for conducting customer interviews and adopting a new mindset,” notes Katsimpouras. “Most importantly, it encouraged me to get out of the building and engage in interviews with potential customers and stakeholders, providing me with invaluable insights and a deeper understanding of my industry,” he adds. These interviews also helped connect the team with companies willing to provide resources to test and improve their technology — a critical step to the scale-up of any lab invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Professor Cem Tasan’s research group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the I-Corps program led them to the J-WAFS Solutions grant, instead of the other way around. Tasan is currently working with postdoc Onur Guvenc on a J-WAFS Solutions project to manufacture formable sheet metal by consolidating steel scrap without melting, thereby reducing water use compared to traditional steel processing. Before applying for the Solutions grant, Guvenc took part in NE I-Corps. Like Katsimpouras, Guvenc benefited from the interaction with industry. “This program required me to step out of the lab and engage with potential customers, allowing me to learn about their immediate challenges and test my initial assumptions about the market,” Guvenc recalls. “My interviews with industry professionals also made me aware of the connection between water consumption and steelmaking processes, which ultimately led to the J-WAFS 2023 Solutions Grant,” says Guvenc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the Spark program, participants may be eligible to apply for the Fusion program, which provides microgrants of up to $1,500 to conduct further customer discovery. The Fusion program is self-paced, requiring teams to conduct 12 additional customer interviews and craft a final presentation summarizing their key learnings. Professor Patrick Doyle’s J-WAFS Solutions team completed the Spark and Fusion programs at MIT. Most recently, their team was accepted to join the NSF I-Corps National program with a $50,000 award. The intensive program requires teams to complete an additional 100 customer discovery interviews over seven weeks. Located in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Doyle lab is working on a sustainable microparticle hydrogel system to rapidly remove micropollutants from water. The team’s focus has expanded to higher value purifications in amino acid and biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Devashish Gokhale PhD ’24 worked with Doyle on much of the underlying science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform technology could potentially be used for selective separations in very diverse market segments, ranging from individual consumers to large industries and government bodies with varied use-cases,” Gokhale explains. He goes on to say, “The I-Corps Spark program added significant value by providing me with an effective framework to approach this problem ... I was assigned a mentor who provided critical feedback, teaching me how to formulate effective questions and identify promising opportunities.” Gokhale says that by the end of Spark, the team was able to identify the best target markets for their products. He also says that the program provided valuable seminars on topics like intellectual property, which was helpful in subsequent discussions the team had with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of Doyle’s team, Arjav Shah, a recent PhD from MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering and a current MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is spearheading the team’s commercialization plans. Shah attended Fusion last fall and hopes to lead efforts to incorporate a startup company called hydroGel.&amp;nbsp; “I admire the hypothesis-driven approach of the I-Corps program,” says Shah. “It has enabled us to identify our customers’ biggest pain points, which will hopefully lead us to finding a product-market fit.” He adds “based on our learnings from the program, we have been able to pivot to impact-driven, higher-value applications in the food processing and biopharmaceutical industries.” Postdoc Luca Mazzaferro will lead the technical team at hydroGel alongside Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different project, Qinmin Zheng, a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is working with Professor Andrew Whittle and Lecturer Fábio Duarte. Zheng plans to take the Fusion course this fall to advance their J-WAFS Solutions project that aims to commercialize a novel sensor to quantify the relative abundance of major algal species and provide early detection of harmful algal blooms. After completing Spark, Zheng says he’s “excited to participate in the Fusion program, and potentially the National I-Corps program, to further explore market opportunities and minimize risks in our future product development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and societal benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing technologies developed at MIT is one of the ways J-WAFS helps ensure that MIT research advances will have real-world impacts in water and food systems. Since its inception, the J-WAFS Solutions program has awarded 28 grants (including renewals), which have supported 19 projects that address a wide range of global water and food challenges. The program has distributed over $4 million to 24 professors, 11 research staff, 15 postdocs, and 30 students across MIT. Nearly half of all J-WAFS Solutions projects have resulted in spinout companies or commercialized products, including eight companies to date plus two open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nona-technologies.com/"&gt;Nona Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a J-WAFS spinout that is helping the world by developing new approaches to produce freshwater for drinking. Desalination — the process of removing salts from seawater — typically requires a large-scale technology called reverse osmosis. But Nona created a desalination device that can work in remote off-grid locations.&amp;nbsp;By separating salt and bacteria from water using electric current through a process called ion concentration polarization (ICP), their technology also reduces overall energy consumption. The novel method was developed by Jongyoon Han, professor of electrical engineering and biological engineering, and research scientist Junghyo Yoon. Along with Bruce Crawford, a Sloan MBA alum, Han and Yoon created Nona Technologies to bring their lightweight, energy-efficient desalination technology to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My feeling early on was that once you have technology, commercialization will take care of itself,” admits Crawford. The team completed both the Spark and Fusion programs and quickly realized that much more work would be required. “Even in our first 24 interviews, we learned that the two first markets we envisioned would not be viable in the near term, and we also got our first hints at the beachhead we ultimately selected,” says Crawford. Nona Technologies has since won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, received media attention from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Newsweek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, and hired a team that continues to further the technology for deployment in resource-limited areas where clean drinking water may be scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-borne diseases sicken millions of people worldwide each year, but J-WAFS researchers are addressing this issue by integrating molecular engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize food pathogen testing. Professors Tim Swager and Alexander Klibanov, of the Department of Chemistry, were awarded one of the first J-WAFS Solutions grants for their sensor that targets food safety pathogens. The sensor uses specialized droplets that behave like a dynamic lens, changing in the presence of target bacteria in order to detect dangerous bacterial contamination in food. In 2018, Swager launched &lt;a href="https://www.xibus.systems/"&gt;Xibus Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to bring the sensor to market and advance food safety for greater public health, sustainability, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our involvement with the J-WAFS Solutions Program has been vital,” says Swager. “It has provided us with a bridge between the academic world and the business world and allowed us to perform more detailed work to create a usable application,” he adds. In 2022, Xibus developed a product called XiSafe, which enables the detection of contaminants like salmonella and listeria faster and with higher sensitivity than other food testing products. The innovation could save food processors billions of dollars worldwide and prevent thousands of food-borne fatalities annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS Solutions companies have raised nearly $66 million in venture capital and other funding. Just this past June, J-WAFS spinout SiTration announced that it raised an $11.8 million seed round. Jeffrey Grossman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, was another early J-WAFS Solutions grantee for his work on low-cost energy-efficient filters for desalination. The project enabled the development of nanoporous membranes and resulted in two spinout companies, &lt;a href="https://viaseparations.com/"&gt;Via Separations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sitration.com/"&gt;SiTration&lt;/a&gt;. SiTration was co-founded by Brendan Smith PhD ’18, who was a part of the original J-WAFS team. Smith is CEO of the company and has overseen the advancement of the membrane technology, which has gone on to reduce cost and resource consumption in industrial wastewater treatment, advanced manufacturing, and resource extraction of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from recycled electric vehicle batteries. The company also recently announced that it is working with the mining company Rio Tinto to handle harmful wastewater generated at mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just J-WAFS spinout companies that are producing real-world results. Products like the ECC Vial — a portable, low-cost method for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; detection in water — have been brought to the market and helped thousands of people. The test kit was developed by MIT D-Lab Lecturer Susan Murcott and Professor Jeffrey Ravel of the MIT History Section. The duo received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2018 to promote safely managed drinking water and improved public health in Nepal, where it is difficult to identify which wells are contaminated by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of their grant period, the team had manufactured approximately 3,200 units, of which 2,350 were distributed — enough to help 12,000 people in Nepal. The researchers also trained local Nepalese on best manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important, in my life experience, to follow your dream and to serve others,” says Murcott. Economic success is important to the health of any venture, whether it’s a company or a product, but equally important is the social impact — a philosophy that J-WAFS research strives to uphold. “Do something because it’s worth doing and because it changes people’s lives and saves lives,” Murcott adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year, we look forward to continued collaboration with MIT’s many I&amp;amp;E programs to advance knowledge and develop solutions that will have tangible effects on the world’s water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions program&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://facts.mit.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/"&gt;innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some people think the world is wildly unpredictable, and are glad insurance can handle the risk and uncertainty they face. Other people believe their destiny is written in the stars, and consult a daily horoscope to reveal what is in store for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, Caley Horan has the history of these things covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan, an associate professor in MIT’s history program, studies multiple topics related to how we handle uncertainty in modern American life. Her award-winning first book, “Insurance Era,” published in 2021 by the University of Chicago Press, examined a deep tension: Insurance is a collective endeavor in certain respects but is defined in individual terms, at least by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized there was a story about insurance in the second half of the 20th century that people hadn’t really written,” Horan says. “It became important to me to tell that story, and to think about both the welfare state and private insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Horan is in the midst of book project tackling another unwritten story: how astrology became a thoroughly modern, commercialized, and American pastime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might seem like quite a departure, but actually, Horan says, her history of astrology grew out of studying insurance history. The connecting tissue is how people themselves view uncertainty, risk, and the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The forms of astrology that evolved in the U.S. over the course of the 20th century turned away from chance, which insurance seeks to cover, and instead offered a theory of causation rooted in external natural phenomena,” Horan says. “The celestial bodies and movements of stars and planets are seen as determining forces, rather than the chance-based world of risk. This creates a clear sense of causation, and of time as cyclical rather than progressing. There’s a real appetite for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, Horan is uncovering how some familiar aspects of contemporary life have taken their current forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that everything has a history is what drew me to history as a field,” Horan says. “It’s tremendously important to have a sense of the past, and I find it endlessly interesting and exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her research and teaching, Horan was granted tenure at MIT last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan, who grew up in Colorado, attended Stanford University, where she was a defender on the soccer team while completing a double major in history and feminist studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I settled on history because it seemed like a really open field,” Horan says. “You can study anything historically. If you want to study film, art, or if you want to study insurance or astrology, you can do so as a historian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan received her BA from Stanford in 2003, then attended graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where she settled on the history of insurance as her dissertation topic and earned her PhD in 2011. She joined the MIT faculty in 2015, while working to turn her thesis into her first book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Insurance Era,” Horan scrutinized high-level political dynamics as the private insurance industry sought to limit the New Deal-era expansion of the public safety net, which it regarded as a threat to its business. Horan also studied this with the lens of a cultural historian, looking at how industry advertising, for instance, portrays the decision to acquire insurance as a highly individualistic endeavor, a matter of personal prudence and savvy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately “Insurance Era” received critical acclaim, winning the 2022 Hagley Prize for the best book in business history, and it has just been published in a new paperback edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrology and the self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Horan is researching and writing her history of astrology — or at least the modern American version of the practice. Earlier in America, what might be called “natural astrology” appeared in almanacs with forecasts about things like the best time to plant crops, as “part of an economy that had a very agrarian nature,” Horan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that economy changed, and so did astrology: Going back a bit more than century, astrology became focused on the self, and became a viable business all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The astrology that we know today in the United States is very recent,” Horan says. “A lot of what we might today call the therapeutic nature of astrology, which is focused on the self and self-knowledge and self-understanding, is a late 19th-century development. By the 20th century, astrology becomes commercialized and part of a capitalist economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper horoscope columns, for instance, date to 1930, along with the invention of “sun-sign” astrology, divided by birth dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think modern astrology has offered people, and continues to offer people, an interpretive framework for understanding identity, self, and relationships to others,&amp;nbsp; at a time when matters of work and identity have been up for grabs,” Horan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her part, Horan’s own sense of identity as a historian is well-established, even as her work evolves: She will continue to pursue topics combining modern business, self-identity, uncertainty, and even health, studying those things in commercial and cultural terms. After she finishes her work on astrology in America, Horan intends to start writing about caregiver work, a growing part of the U.S. economy. And, she says, she continues to follow developments in insurance closely, with a return to that topic possible as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do feel some of the big-picture issues I have raised about insurance are very relevant,” Horan says. “That includes issues about the power we accord to private industry, how we think about collective organization, how Americans think about data and who controls their data, and how society distributes its resources, including basic insurance coverage. I think we’re heading into uncharted territory with some of these matters, and I do hope some of the questions I’ve raised continue to inform the way scholars are thinking about them.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dean Agustín Rayo and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences recently welcomed nine new professors to the MIT community. They arrive with diverse backgrounds and vast knowledge in their areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonya Atalay&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Anthropology Section as a professor. She is a public anthropologist and archaeologist who studies Indigenous science protocols, practices, and research methods carried out with and for Indigenous communities. Atalay is the director and principal investigator of the Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science, a newly established National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. She has expertise in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and served two terms on the National NAGPRA Review Committee, first appointed by the Bush administration and then for a second term by the Obama administration. Atalay has produced a series of research-based comics in partnership with Native nations about repatriation of Native American ancestral remains, return of sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony under NAGPRA law. Atalay earned her PhD in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Huang &lt;/strong&gt;SM ’08 joins the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Music and Theater Arts as assistant professor. She will help develop graduate programming focused on music technology. Previously, she spent eight years with Magenta at Google Brain and DeepMind, spearheading efforts in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction to support human-AI partnerships in music-making. She is the creator of Music Transformer and Coconet (which powered the Bach Google Doodle). She was a judge and organizer for the AI Song Contest. Anna holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila, a BM in music composition, a BS in computer science from the University of Southern California, an MS from the MIT Media Lab, and a PhD from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elena Kempf&lt;/strong&gt; joins the History Section as an assistant professor. She is an historian of modern Europe with special interests in international law and modern Germany in its global context. Her current book project is a legal, political, and cultural history of weapons prohibitions in modern international law from the 1860s to the present. Before joining MIT, Kempf was a postdoc at the Miller Institute for Global Challenges and the Law at UC Berkeley and a lecturer at the Department of History at Stanford University. Elena earned her PhD in history from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthias Michel &lt;/strong&gt;joins the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy as an assistant professor. Matthias completed his PhD in philosophy in 2019 at Sorbonne Université. Before coming to MIT, he was a Bersoff Faculty Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at New York University. His research is at the intersection between philosophy and cognitive science, and focuses on philosophical issues related to the scientific study of consciousness. His current work addresses questions such as how to distinguish entities with minds from those without, which animals are sentient, and which mental functions can be performed unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob Moscona&lt;/strong&gt; PhD ’21 is a new assistant professor in the Department of Economics. His research explores broad questions in economic development, with a focus on the role of innovation, the environment, and political economy. One stream of his research investigates the forces that drive the rate and direction of technological progress, as well as how new technologies shape global productivity differences and adaptation to major threats like climate change. Another stream of his research studies the political economy of economic development, with a focus on how variation in social organization and institutions affects patterns of conflict and cooperation. Prior to joining MIT, he was a Prize Fellow in Economics, History, and Politics at Harvard University. He received his BA from Harvard in 2016 and PhD from MIT in 2021. Outside of MIT, Jacob enjoys playing and performing music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sendhil Mullainathan&lt;/strong&gt; joins the departments of EECS and Economics as the Peter de Florez Professor. His research uses machine learning to understand complex problems in human behavior, social policy, and medicine. Previously, Mullainathan spent five years at MIT before joining the faculty at Harvard in 2004, and then the University of Chicago in 2018. He received his BA in computer science, mathematics, and economics from Cornell University and his PhD from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elise Newman&lt;/strong&gt; PhD ’21 is a new assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. Her forthcoming monograph, “When arguments merge,” studies the ingredients that languages use to construct verb phrases, and examines how those ingredients interact with other linguistic processes such as question formation. By studying these interactions, she forms a hypothesis about how different languages’ verb phrases can be distinct from each other, and what they must have in common, providing insight into this aspect of the human language faculty. In addition to the structural properties of language, Newman also has expertise in semantics (the study of meaning) and first language acquisition. She returns to MIT after a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, after completing her PhD in linguistics at MIT in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver Rollins&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Program in Science, Technology, and Society as an assistant professor. He is a qualitative sociologist who explores the sociological dimensions of neuroscientific knowledge and technologies. His work primarily illustrates the way race, racialized discourses, and systemic practices of social difference impact and are shaped by the development and use of neuroscience. His book, “Conviction: The Making and Unmaking of The Violent Brain” (Stanford University Press, 2021), traces the evolution of neuroimaging research on antisocial behavior, stressing the limits of this controversial brain model when dealing with aspects of social inequality. Rollins’s second book project will grapple with the legacies of scientific racism in and through the mind and brain sciences, elucidating how the haunting presence of race endures through modern neuroscientific theories, data, and technologies. Rollins recently received an NSF CAREER Award to investigate the intersections between social justice and science. Through this project, he aims to examine the sociopolitical vulnerabilities, policy possibilities, and anti-racist promises for contemporary (neuro)science. Rollins received his PhD in sociology from the University of California at San Francisco. Before joining MIT, he held faculty positions at the University of Washington and the University of Louisville and was a postdoc in the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Race, Science, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ishani Saraf&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Program in Science, Technology, and Society as an assistant professor. She is a sociocultural anthropologist. Her research studies the transformation and trade of discarded machines in translocal spaces in India and the Indian Ocean, where she focuses on questions of postcolonial capitalism, urban belonging, material practices, situated bodies of knowledge, and environmental governance. She received her PhD from the University of California at Davis, and prior to joining MIT, she was a postdoc and lecturer at the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tristan Brown is the S.C. Fang Chinese Language and Culture Career Development Professor at MIT. He specializes in law, science, environment and religion of late imperial China, a period running from the 16th through early 20th centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this Q&amp;amp;A, Brown discusses how his areas of historical research can be useful for examining today’s pressing environmental challenges. This is part of an ongoing series exploring how the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences is addressing the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why does this era of Chinese history resonate so much for you? How is it relevant to contemporary times and challenges?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;China has always been interesting to historians because it has a long-recorded history, with data showing how people have coped with environmental and climate changes over the centuries. We have tons of records of various kinds of ecological issues, environmental crises, and the associated outbreaks of calamities, famine, epidemics, and warfare. Historians of China have a lot to offer ongoing conversations about climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I research conflicts over land and resources that erupted when China was undergoing huge environmental, economic, demographic, and political pressures, and the role that feng shui played as local communities and the state tried to mediate those conflicts. [Feng shui is an ancient Chinese practice combining cosmology, spatial aesthetics, and measurement to divine the right balance between the natural and built environment.]&amp;nbsp;Ultimately, the Qing (1644-1912) state was unable to manage these conflicts, and feng shui–based attempts to make decisions about conserving or exploiting certain areas blew up by the end of the 19th century in the face of pressures to industrialize. This is the subject of my first book, “&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246734/laws-of-the-land"&gt;Laws of the Land: Fengshui and the State in Qing Dynasty China&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you give a sense of how feng shui was used to determine outcomes in environmental cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We tend to think of feng shui as a popular design mechanism today. While this isn’t completely inaccurate, there was much more to it than that in Chinese history, when it evolved over many centuries. Specifically, there are lots of insights in feng shui that reflect the ways in which people recorded the natural world, explained how components in the environment related to one another, and understood why and how bad things happened. There is an interesting concept in feng shui that your environment affects your health,and specifically your children’s (i.e., descendants and progeny) health. That concept is found across premodern feng shui literature and is one of fundamental principles of the whole knowledge system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period I research, the Qing, the primary fuel energy sources in China came from timber and coal. There were legal cases where communities argued against efforts to mine a local mountain, saying that it could injure the feng shui (i.e., undermine the cosmological balance of natural forces and spatial integrity) of a mountain and hurt the fortunes of an entire region. People were suspicious of coal mining in their communities. They had seen or heard about mines collapsing and flooded mine shafts, they had watched runoff ruin good farmland, causing crops to fail, and even perhaps children to fall ill. Coal mining disturbed the human-earth connection, and thus the relationship between people and nature. People invoked feng shui to express an idea that the extraction of rocks and minerals from the land can have detrimental effects on living communities. Whether out of a sincere community-based concern or out of a more self-interested &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" target="_blank"&gt;NIMBYism&lt;/a&gt;, feng shui was the primary discourse invoked in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all efforts to conserve areas from mining succeeded, especially as foreign imperialism encroached on China, threatening government and local control over the economy. It became gradually clear to China’s elites that the country had to industrialize to survive, and this involved the difficult and even violent process of taking people from farm work and bringing them to cities, building railways, cutting millions of trees, and mining coal to power it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;This makes it seem as if the Chinese swept away feng shui whenever it presented a hurdle, putting the country on the path to coal dependence, pollution, and a carbon-emitting future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Feng shui has not disappeared in China, but there’s no doubt about it that development in the form of industrialization took precedence in the 20th century, when it became officially labelled a “superstition” on the national stage. When I first went to China in 2007, city air was so polluted I couldn’t see the horizon. I was 18 years old and the air in some northern cities like Shijiazhuang honestly felt scary. I’ve returned many times since then, of course, and there has been great improvement in air quality, because the government made it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feng shui is a future-oriented knowledge, concerned with identifying events that have happened in the past that are related to things happening today, and using that information to influence future events. As &lt;a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/richard-j-smith"&gt;Richard Smith&lt;/a&gt; of Rice University argues, Chinese have used history to order the past, ritual to order the present, and divination to order the future. Consider, for instance, Xiong’an, a new development area outside of Beijing that is physically marking the era of Xi Jinping’s tenure as paramount leader. As soon as the site was selected, people in China started talking about its feng shui, both out of potential environmental concerns and as a subtle form of political commentary. MIT’s own &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/andrew-stokols"&gt;Sol Andrew Stokols&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) has a fantastic new dissertation examining that new area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the feng shui masters of old said there will be floods and droughts and bad stuff happening in the future if a course correction isn’t made. But at the same time, in feng shui there's never a situation that is hopeless; there is no lost cause. So, there is optimism in the knowledge and rhetoric of feng shui that I think might be applicable as time goes on with climate change. As long as you have a future, you can still change it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;In 2023, you were awarded one of the first grants of MIT’s Climate Nucleus, the faculty committee charged with seeing through the Institute’s climate action plan over the decade. What have you been up to courtesy of this fund?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it all started years ago, when I started thinking about great number of mountains in China associated with Buddhism or Daoism that have become national parks in recent decades. Some of these mountains host trees and plant species that are not found in any other part of China. For my grant, I wanted to find out how these mountains have managed to incubate such rare species for the last 2,000 years. And it's not as simple as just saying, well, Buddhism, right?&amp;nbsp;Because there are plenty of Buddhist mountains that have not fared as well ecologically. The religious landscape is part of the answer, but there’s also all the messiness of material history that surrounds such a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this grant, I am bringing together a group of scholars of religion, historians, as well as engineers working in conservation ecology, and we’re trying to figure out what makes some of these places religiously and environmentally distinctive. People come to the project with different approaches. My MIT colleague &lt;a href="https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/serguei-saavedra/"&gt;Serguei Saavedra&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering uses new models in system ecology to measure the resilience of environments under various stresses. My colleague in religious studies, &lt;a href="https://cris.tau.ac.il/en/persons/or-porath"&gt;Or Porath&lt;/a&gt; at Tel Aviv University, is asking when and how Asian religions have centered — or ignored — animals and animal welfare. Another collaboration with MIT’s &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/siqi-zheng"&gt;Siqi Zheng&lt;/a&gt; in DUSP and &lt;a href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/1480-wenchi-liao"&gt;Wen-Chi Liao&lt;/a&gt; at the National University of Singapore is looking at how we can use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and classical feng shui manuals to teach computers how to analyze the value of a property’s feng shui in Sinophone communities around the world. There’s a lot going on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How do you bring China’s unique environmental history and law into your classroom, and make it immediate and relevant to the world students face today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;History is always part of the answer. I mean, whether it’s for an economist, a political scientist, or an architect, history matters. Likewise, when you’re confronting climate change and all these struggles regarding the environment and various crises involving ecosystems, it’s always a good idea to look at how human beings in the past dealt with similar crises. It doesn’t give you a prediction on what would happen in the future, but it gives you some range of possibilities, many of which may at first appear counterintuitive or surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what the humanities do. My job is to make MIT undergraduates care about a people who are no longer alive, who walked the earth a thousand years ago, who confronted terrible times of conflict and hunger. Sometimes these people left behind a written record about their world, and sometimes they didn’t. But we try to hear them out regardless. I want students to develop empathy for these strangers and wonder what it would be like to walk in their shoes. Every one of those people is someone’s ancestor, and they very well could have been your ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my class 21H.186 (Nature and Environment in China), we look&amp;nbsp;at the historical precedents that might be useful for today’s environmental challenges, ranging from urban pollution or domestic recycling systems.&amp;nbsp;The fact we’re still here to ask historical questions is itself significant. When we feel despair about climate change, we can ask, “How did individuals endure the changed course of the Yellow River or the Little Ice Age?” Even when it is recording tragedies, history can be understood as an enduring form of hope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) recently organized and hosted a two-day symposium, The History of Technology: Past, Present, and Future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The symposium was held June 7-8 at MIT’s Wong Auditorium, and featured scholars from a variety of institutions with expertise in the history of technology. Each presented their ideas about the intersection of science, technology, and society, the field’s needs, and opportunities for its future development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We’re pleased to provide a venue in which these kinds of conversations can occur,” said Deborah Fitzgerald, STS program head and former dean of MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The symposium opened with welcoming remarks from Fitzgerald and MIT Professor Merritt Roe Smith. Fitzgerald and Smith are both Leverett Howell and William King Cutten Professors of the History of Technology at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“These kinds of gatherings — of old friends and colleagues and several generations of&amp;nbsp;students — create new opportunities to advance scholarship, create connections, and keep abreast of what’s happening in the field,” Smith said. “Seeing the future through the lens of our shared pasts&amp;nbsp;adds an important perspective on current innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More than 20 scholars made presentations during the symposium. The topics and speakers included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;David Lucsko PhD ’05, professor of history at Auburn University:&amp;nbsp;“How Things Work and Why It Matters — or, Why Poring over Automotive Wiring Diagrams from the 1970s Isn’t Actually a Colossal Waste of Time;”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Dave Unger, an independent public historian: “Tools for Imagining a Better World: Social Technology, Organizational Dark Matter, and Reading for Difference;”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Gregory Clancey, associate professor at the National University of Singapore: “The History of Technology in an Age of Mass Extinction;” and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Ruth Schwartz Cowan, professor emerita at the University of Pennsylvania: “Does the History of Technology have a Paradigm?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>The unexpected origins of a modern finance tool</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Discounting calculations are ubiquitous today — thanks partly to the English clergy who spread them amid turmoil in the 1600s, an MIT scholar shows.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early 1600s, the officials running Durham Cathedral, in England, had serious financial problems. Soaring prices had raised expenses. Most cathedral income came from renting land to tenant farmers, who had long leases so officials could not easily raise the rent. Instead, church leaders started charging periodic fees, but these often made tenants furious. And the 1600s, a time of religious schism, was not the moment to alienate church members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 1626, Durham officials found a formula for fees that tenants would accept. If tenant farmers paid a fee equal to one year’s net value of the land, it earned them a seven-year lease. A fee equal to 7.75 years of net value earned a 21-year lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a form of discounting, the now-common technique for evaluating the present and future value of money by assuming a certain rate of return on that money. The Durham officials likely got their numbers from new books of discounting tables. Volumes like this had never existed before, but suddenly local church officials were applying the technique up and down England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As financial innovation stories go, this one is unusual. Normally, avant-garde financial tools might come from, well, the financial avant-garde — bankers, merchants, and investors hunting for short-term profits, not clergymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have assumed these very sophisticated calculations would have been implemented by hard-nosed capitalists, because really powerful calculations would allow you to get an economic edge and increase profits,” says MIT historian William Deringer, an expert in the deployment of quantitative reasoning in public life. “But that was not the primary or only driver in this situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deringer has published a new research article about this episode, “&lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/728594" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Aecroid’s Tables: Economic Calculations and Social Customs in the Early Modern Countryside&lt;/a&gt;,” appearing in the current issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Modern History&lt;/em&gt;. In it, he uses archival research to explore how the English clergy started using discounting, and where. And one other question: Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter inflation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, discounting is a pervasive tool. A dollar in the present is worth more than a dollar a decade from now, since one can earn money investing it in the meantime. This concept heavily informs investment markets, corporate finance, and even the NFL draft (where trading this year’s picks yields a greater haul of future picks). As the historian William N. Goetzmann has written, the related idea of net present value “is the most important tool in modern finance.” But while discounting was known as far back as the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (often called Fibonacci) in the 1200s, why were English clergy some of its most enthusiastic early adopters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer involves a global change in the 1500s: the “price revolution,” in which things began costing more, after a long period when prices had been constant. That is, inflation hit the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People up to that point lived with the expectation that prices would stay the same,” Deringer says. “The idea that prices changed in a systematic way was shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Durham Cathedral, inflation meant the organization had to pay more for goods while three-quarters of its revenues came from tenant rents, which were hard to alter. Many leases were complex, and some were locked in for a tenant’s lifetime. The Durham leaders did levy intermittent fees on tenants, but that led to angry responses and court cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, tenants had additional leverage against the Church of England: religious competition following the Reformation. England’s political and religious schisms would lead it to a midcentury civil war. Maybe some private landholders could drastically increase fees, but the church did not want to lose followers that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individual landowners could be ruthlessly economic, but the church couldn’t, because it’s in the midst of incredible political and religious turmoil after the Reformation,” Deringer says. “The Church of England is in this precarious position. They’re walking a line between Catholics who don’t think there should have been a Reformation, and Puritans who don’t think there should be bishops. If they’re perceived to be hurting their flock, it would have real consequences. The church is trying to make the finances work but in a way that’s just barely tolerable to the tenants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the books of discounting tables, which allowed local church leaders to finesse the finances. Essentially, discounting more carefully calibrated the upfront fees tenants would periodically pay. Church leaders could simply plug in the numbers as compromise solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this period, England’s first prominent discounting book with tables was published in 1613; its most enduring, Ambrose Acroyd’s “Table of Leasses and Interest,” dated to 1628-29. Acroyd was the bursar at Trinity College at Cambridge University, which as a landholder (and church-affiliated institution) faced the same issues concerning inflation and rent. Durham Cathedral began using off-the-shelf discounting formulas in 1626, resolving decades of localized disagreement as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performing fairness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discounting tables from books did not only work because the price was right. Once circulating clergy had popularized the notion throughout England, local leaders could justify using the books because others were doing it. The clergy were “performing fairness,” as Deringer puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strict calculative rules assured tenants and courts that fines were reasonable, limiting landlords’ ability to maximize revenues,” Deringer writes in the new article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, local church leaders in England were using discounting for their own economic self-interest. It just wasn’t the largest short-term economic self-interest possible. And it was a sound strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Durham they would fight with tenants every 20 years [in the 1500s] and come to a new deal, but eventually that evolves into these sophisticated mechanisms, the discounting tables,” Deringer adds. “And you get standardization. By about 1700, it seems like these procedures are used everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Deringer writes, “mathematical tables for setting fines were not so much instruments of a capitalist transformation as the linchpin holding together what remained of an older system of customary obligations stretched nearly to breaking by macroeconomic forces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discounting was widely introduced, it never went away. Deringer’s &lt;em&gt;Journal of Modern History&lt;/em&gt; article is part of a larger book project he is currently pursuing, about discounting in many facets of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deringer was able to piece together the history of discounting in 17th-century England thanks in part to archival clues. For instance, Durham University owns a 1686 discounting book self-described as an update to Acroyd’s work; that copy was owned by a Durham Cathedral administrator in the 1700s. Of the 11 existing copies of Acroyd’s work, two are at Canterbury Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hints like that helped Deringer recognize that church leaders were very interested in discounting; his further research helped him see that this chapter in the history of discounting is not merely about finance; it also opens a new window into the turbulent 1600s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never expected to be researching church finances, I didn’t expect it to have anything to do with the countryside, landlord-tenant relationships, and tenant law,” Deringer says. “I was seeing this as an interesting example of a story about bottom-line economic calculation, and it wound up being more about this effort to use calculation to resolve social tensions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To address the climate crisis, one must understand environmental history. MIT Professor Kate Brown’s research has typically focused on environmental catastrophes. More recently, Brown has been exploring a more hopeful topic: tiny gardens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brown is the Thomas M. Siebel Distinguished Professor in History of Science in the MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society. In this Q&amp;amp;A, Brown discusses her research, and how she believes her current project could help put power into the hands of everyday people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of an ongoing series exploring how the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences is addressing the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You have created an unusual niche for yourself as an historian of environmental catastrophes. What drew you to such a dismal beat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Historians often study New York, Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, but if you go to these little towns that nobody's ever heard of, that's where you see the destruction in the wake of progress. This is likely because I grew up in a manufacturing town in the Midwestern Rust Belt, watching stores go bankrupt and houses sit empty. I became very interested in the people who were the last to turn off the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Did this interest in places devastated by technological and economic change eventually lead to your investigation of Chernobyl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I first studied the health and environmental consequences of radioactive waste on communities near nuclear weapons facilities in the U.S. and Russia, and then decided to focus on the health and environmental impacts of fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear energy plant disaster.&amp;nbsp;After gaining access to the KGB records in Kiev, I realized that there was a Klondike of records describing what Soviet officials at the time called a “public health disaster.” People on the ground recognized the saturation of radioactivity into environments and food supplies not with any with sensitive devices, but by noticing the changes in ecologies and on human bodies. I documented how Moscow leaders historically and decades later engaged in a coverup, and that even international bodies charged with examining nuclear issues were reluctant to acknowledge this ongoing public health disaster due to liabilities in their own countries from the production and testing of nuclear weapons during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why did you turn from detailed studies of what you call “modernist wastelands” to the subject of climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Journalists and scholars have worked hard in the last two decades to get people to understand the scope and the scale and the verisimilitude of climate change. And that’s great, but some of these catastrophic stories we tell don’t make people feel very safe or secure. They have a paralyzing effect on us. Climate change is one of many problems that are too big for any one person to tackle, or any one entity, whether it’s a huge nation like the United States or an international body like the U.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would start to work on something that is very small scale that puts action in the hands of just regular people to try to tell a more hopeful story. I am finishing a new book about working-class people who got pushed off their farms in the 19th century, and ended up in mega cities like London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Washington D.C., find land on the periphery of the cities. They start digging, growing their own food, cooperating together. They basically recreated forms of the commons in cities. And in so doing, they generate the most productive agriculture in recorded history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are some highlights of this extraordinary city-based food generation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;In Paris circa 1900, 5,000 urban farmers grew fruits and vegetables and fresh produce for 2 million Parisians with a surplus left over to sell to London. They would plant three to six crops a year on one tract of land using horse manure to heat up soils from below to push the season and grow spring crops in winter and summer crops in spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agricultural economist looked at the inputs and the outputs from these Parisian farms. He found there was no comparison to the Green Revolution fields of the 1970s. These urban gardeners were producing far more per acre, with no petroleum-based fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What is the connection between little gardens like these and the global climate crisis, where individuals can feel at loss facing the scale of the problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; You can think of a tiny city garden like a coral reef, where one little worm comes and builds its cave. And then another one attaches itself to the first, and so on.&amp;nbsp;Pretty soon you have a great coral reef with a platform to support hundreds of different species — a rich biodiversity. Tiny gardens work that way in cities, which is one reason cities are now surprising hotspots of biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming urban green space into tiny gardens doesn’t take an act of God, the U.N., or the U.S. Congress to make a change. You could just go to your municipality and say, “Listen, right now we have a zoning code that says every time there's a new condo, you have to have one or two parking spaces, but we’d rather see one or two garden spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you don't want a garden, you’ll have a neighbor who does. So people are outside and they have their hands in the soil and then they start to exchange produce with one another. As they share carrots and zucchini, they exchange soil and human microbes as well. We know that when people share microbiomes, they get along better, have more in common. It comes as no surprise that humans have organized societies around shaking hands, kissing on the cheek, producing food together and sharing meals. That’s what I think we've lost in our remote worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So can we address or mitigate the impacts of climate change on a community-by-community basis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I believe that’s probably the best way to do it. When we think of energy we often imagine deposits of oil or gas, but, as our grad student Turner Adornetto points out, every environment has energy running through it.&amp;nbsp;Every environment has its own best solution. If it’s a community that lives along a river, tap into hydropower; or if it’s a community that has tons of organic waste, maybe you want to use microbial power; and if it’s a community that has lots of sun then use different kinds of solar power. The legacy of midcentury modernism is that engineers came up with one-size-fits-all solutions to plug in anywhere in the world, regardless of local culture, traditions, or environment. That is one of the problems that has gotten us into this fix in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politically, it’s a good idea to avoid making people feel they’re being pushed around by one set of codes, one set of laws in terms of coming up with solutions that work. There are ways of deriving energy and nutrients that enrich the environment, ways that don’t drain and deplete. You see that so clearly with a plant, which just does nothing but grow and contribute and give, whether it’s in life or in death. It’s just constantly improving its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How do you unleash creativity and propagate widespread local responses to climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the important things we are trying to accomplish in the humanities is communicating in the most down-to-earth ways possible to our students and the public so that anybody — from a fourth grader to a retired person — can get engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s “TECHNOLOGY” in uppercase letters, the kind that is invented and patented in places like MIT. And then there’s technology in lowercase letters, where people are working with things readily at hand. That is the kind of creativity we don’t often pay enough attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that at the end of the 19th century, scientists were sure that the earth was cooling and the earth would all under ice by 2020. In the 1950s, many people feared nuclear warfare. In the 1960s the threat was the “population bomb.” Every generation seems to have its apocalyptic sense of doom. It is helpful to take climate change and the Anthropocene and put them in perspective. These are problems we can solve.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Forging her own path</title>

  <description><![CDATA[By blending mechanical engineering, creative writing, and history studies, senior Amber Velez is discovering new ways of addressing climate change.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Danna Lorch | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Turning a problem upside down comes naturally to senior Amber Velez. She’d trained in trapeze and aerial circus arts for several years, but buying her own circular aerial hoop, called a lyra, was prohibitively expensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, as a sophomore, Velez decided to make an affordable lyra herself in a lab on campus. There, staff showed her how to use a tube roller tool to form the lyra’s curved shape. “MIT is a community where everyone is generally very willing to help everyone else,” she discovered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, she took an introductory metalsmithing course at the &lt;a href="https://metalslab.mit.edu/metal-classes"&gt;Merton C. Flemings Materials Processing Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. After passing a safety test, Velez had free rein to experiment independently in the popular space where students have been forging since 1892. At a school known for pioneering the next technical advances, she forged a sword with a dragon hilt using ancient technology over simple open flame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velez moves her lyra between favorite spots on campus, suspending it from columns or trees. “More importantly than teaching you how to make things at MIT, you learn that you have the ability to gain the skills to figure out what you want to do and to make it happen,” she reflects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A creative approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking a gap year backpacking through Europe and gathering her thoughts, Velez arrived at MIT with a plan. Growing up in Tucson, Arizona, she watched helplessly as climate change hit the surrounding Sonoran Desert hard. She wanted to make a difference through activism, STEM studies, and writing fantasy fiction about how the world could be different and better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After assembling an engine by hand in an introductory mechanical engineering (MechE) course, she declared her first major and forged a career path. She explains, “I love making things — and that was something I had never realized until coming to college and trying engineering.” Her research focuses on clean energy and decarbonization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velez built her second major by hand, too. Creative Writing in History is an interdisciplinary program sponsored through the &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velez took three history classes each semester of her sophomore year before realizing she had accumulated enough credits for a major. When she learned that a history thesis would be the capstone requirement, Velez decided that she would prefer to do a creative writing thesis instead — and fold in some literature courses, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Activism and politics, for me, have always been grounded in history. I enjoy setting my fantasy in historical periods,” she says. After submitting some paperwork with the support of a faculty sponsor, she received approval from the SHASS registrar. “The process was very straightforward.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Velez has taken three courses with her thesis advisor, &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/jterrones/"&gt;Joaquin Terrones&lt;/a&gt;, including 21L.504 (Race, Gender, and Secret Identities in U.S. Superhero Comics). She says, “His classes have made me think a lot about representation in fiction and how I want to contribute toward it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velez’s thesis will comprise a debut collection of short stories in the fantasy genre. Each piece is based in the Sonoran Desert at different periods in history — some of them imagined. “It’s the only place in the world with really tall cacti that have arms,” she says, visibly excited to talk about the unique, occasionally otherworldly environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s seen her writing come together with MechE in surprising ways that have the potential to effect change. Velez says, “I study history to understand what needs to be changed, and I write about our world and the ways it can be better. That guides where I apply my MechE skills, into sustainable energy. On the flip side, my understanding of technology contributes to how I imagine fictional worlds and innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing her story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through her role as a &lt;a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/avelez9/"&gt;student blogger&lt;/a&gt; for MIT Admissions, Velez discovered a community of writers. She started blogging in her first year. “It’s been a really cool playground to see myself mature in,” she reflects. “Coming in as a Latina student and a minority, I put a lot of pressure on myself to show people back home that I deserve to be here and not give anyone fodder to think otherwise.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that first year, when she enrolled in an advanced physics class without first fulfilling the prerequisite coursework in differential equations, and struggled, that fear ultimately melted away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She recalls, “This class was going badly, my ego was suffering, and I was panicking. I wrote this &lt;a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/wrestling-with-my-ego/"&gt;really passionate blog post&lt;/a&gt; about dropping the class and prioritizing learning material over my own pride.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a brave and honest piece, and the community of MIT bloggers and her readers rallied around her in support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, something in Velez shifted and strengthened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, she says, “I’m writing for young high school girls or Latinx students, and I am showing them that you don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be pushing yourself and learning.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Materials from MIT’s Distinctive Collections reveal stories of women at the Institute. ]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Brigham Fay | MIT Libraries</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This spring, two new exhibits on campus are shining a light on the critical contributions of pathbreaking women at the Institute. They are part of MIT Libraries’ &lt;a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=991573&amp;amp;p=7173940"&gt;Women@MIT Archival Initiative&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Distinctive Collections. Launched in 2017, the initiative not only adds to the historical record by collecting and preserving the papers of MIT-affiliated women, it shares their lives and work with global audiences through exhibits, multimedia projects, educational materials, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the Lens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under the Lens: Women Biologists and Chemists at MIT 1865-2024,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;examines the work of women in science and engineering at MIT beginning with &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/scene-at-mit-ellen-swallow-richards-womens-laboratory-0321"&gt;Ellen Swallow Richards&lt;/a&gt;, the Institute’s first female student and instructor, through the present day, when a number of women with backgrounds in biology, biological engineering, chemistry, and chemical engineering — the subjects of focus in this exhibit — hold leadership positions at the Institute, including President &lt;a href="https://president.mit.edu/#:~:text=Sally%20Kornbluth%20is%20MIT%27s%2018th%20president.&amp;amp;text=MIT%20has%20a%20distinctive%20recipe,to%20confront%20society%27s%20hardest%20problems."&gt;Sally Kornbluth&lt;/a&gt;, Vice Provost for Faculty &lt;a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/paula-t-hammond/"&gt;Paula Hammond&lt;/a&gt;, and Professor &lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/amy-e-keating/" target="_blank"&gt;Amy Keating&lt;/a&gt;, who heads the Department of Biology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exhibit curator Thera Webb, Women@MIT project archivist, explains the exhibit title’s double meaning: “The women featured in 'Under the Lens' are scientists whose work engages with the materials of our world on a molecular level, using the lens of a microscope,” she says. “The title also plays on the fact that women’s ability to work as scientists and academics has been scrutinized through the lens of public opinion since Victorian-era debates about co-education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items for the exhibit, selected from Distinctive Collections, demonstrate the experiences of women students, research staff, and faculty. They include the 1870 handwritten faculty meeting notes admitting Richards, then Ellen Henrietta Swallow, as MIT’s first female student, stating “the Faculty are of the opinion that the admission of women as special students is as yet in the nature of an experiment.” Materials from alumna and late professor &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/chokyun-rha-professor-0317"&gt;ChoKyun Rha&lt;/a&gt;’s “Rheological Characterization of Printing Ink,” circa 1979, include images of the development process of ink and data from experiments. Also on display are a lab coat and rodent brain tissue slides from the neuroscience laboratory of &lt;a href="https://hockfield.mit.edu/"&gt;Susan Hockfield&lt;/a&gt;, MIT’s 16th president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The collections we have related to women at MIT not only show us what their academic and professional interests were, with items like lab notebooks and drafts of papers, but also how our MIT community has been actively supporting women in science,” says Webb. “Many of our alumnae and faculty have been involved with the founding of groups like the Association of American University Women, the MIT Women’s Association, the Association for Women in Science, and the Women in Chemistry Group.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Under the Lens: Women Biologists and Chemists at MIT 1865-2024” is&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on view in the Maihaugen Gallery (Room 14N-130) through June 21. There is an accompanying &lt;a href="https://digital-exhibits.libraries.mit.edu/s/under-the-lens/page/exhibit"&gt;digital exhibit&lt;/a&gt; available on the MIT Libraries’ website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sisters in Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sisters in Making: Prototyping and the Feminine Resilience,” on view in Rotch Library, explores the unseen women, often referred to as “weavers,” who were instrumental to the development of computers. The exhibit, the work of Deborah Tsogbe SM '23 and Soala Ajienka, a current architecture graduate student, spotlights the women who built the core rope memory and magnetic core memory for the Apollo Guidance Computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While we ultimately know the names of the first men on the Moon, and of those who spearheaded the engineering initiatives behind the Apollo 11 mission, the names of the countless women who had a vital hand in realizing these feats have been missing from historical discourse,” Tsogbe and Ajienka write. “The focus of our work has been to uncover the names and faces of these women, who held important positions including overseeing communications, checking codes, running calculations, and weaving memory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in the archives, Tsogbe and Ajienka sought to identify the women involved in this endeavor, going through personnel logs, press releases, and other historical artifacts. Originally focused on the women working on rope memory, they broadened the scope of women involved in the journey to the moon and were able to name 534 women across 29 classes of work and nine organizations. Tsogbe and Ajienka fabricated a core memory prototype with the names of some of these women stored; they were technicians, data key punchers, engineers, librarians, and office staff from MIT, Raytheon, and NASA. Called the “memory dialer,” the prototype is intended to be a living archive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsogbe and Ajienka created “Sisters in Making”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as 2023 Women@MIT Fellows. This &lt;a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=991573&amp;amp;p=10064824"&gt;fellowship&lt;/a&gt; invites scholars, artists, and others to showcase materials from Distinctive Collections in engaging ways that contribute to greater understanding of the history of women at MIT and in STEM. The project also received a grant from the Council for the Arts at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Deborah and Soala’s exhibit shows the variety of ways that the rich materials in the Women@MIT collections can be used,” says Webb. “Projects like these really highlight the value of historical collections in ways outside of traditional scholarly publications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sisters in Making: Prototyping and the Feminine Resilience” is on view in Rotch Library (Room 7-238) through April 8.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Kylie Foy | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) designated three historical MIT Lincoln Laboratory technologies as IEEE Milestones. The technologies are the Mode S air traffic control (ATC) radar beacon system, 193-nanometer (nm) photolithography, and the semiconductor laser. The latter recognition is shared by Lincoln Laboratory, General Electric, and IBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world's largest technical professional organization, the IEEE's mission is to "advance technology for the benefit of humanity." The Milestone program commemorates innovations developed at least 25 years ago that have done just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three technologies are integral to everyday life. Anyone who has flown on commercial aircraft has benefited from Mode S, the system that air traffic controllers use to track planes. The integrated circuits that power modern computing and communication devices were manufactured using 193 nm photolithography. Perhaps most ubiquitous of all is the semiconductor laser — a micrometer-sized light-emitting device that has made possible high-speed internet, among many other technologies underpinning today's information society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"MIT Lincoln Laboratory has been a leader in fostering innovations that&amp;nbsp;were previously only considered possible in science fiction. The three IEEE Milestones presented are a testament to those accomplishments and a celebration of the diversity of ingenuity and teamwork that created these game-changing technologies," says Karen Panetta, vice chair of IEEE Boston Section, which presented the awards to Lincoln Laboratory at a ceremony on Feb. 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Laboratory holds three previous IEEE Milestones for pioneering the use of packet networks for speech communications, for developing the nation's first air defense system, and for creating the Whirlwind high-speed digital computer in collaboration with MIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking aircraft globally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mode S ATC radar beacon system was developed to address the challenges posed to the existing ATC beacon-radar system used in the late 1960s. Commercial air traffic was growing quickly, causing interference between beacon replies and interrogations from ATC ground radars. This interference threatened to disrupt aircraft surveillance in high-density airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sponsorship, Lincoln Laboratory led the technology developments necessary to address this safety issue. The advanced communication architecture of Mode S allowed radars to select a specific aircraft to interrogate. To selectively communicate, the system design included improved aircraft transponders, each assigned a unique address code. Upgrades to radar antennas and signal processing also allowed Mode S to accurately determine airplane position with far fewer air-to-ground messages than required by prior systems. Mode S also provided a datalink capability that enabled other key safety systems, such as the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Mode S is a worldwide industry standard. An estimated 100,000 aircraft are equipped with Mode S transponders, and more than 900 Mode S radars are deployed across the globe. The technology is also the foundation for the FAA's newest ATC surveillance system, which allows continuous flight tracking independent of ground radars by using aircraft-broadcast position and velocity information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This technology touches everybody who flies, every time they fly, for the entire duration of their flight," says Wesley Olson, a group leader in the laboratory's Homeland Protection and Air Traffic Control Division, where Mode S was first envisioned. "If it wasn't for Mode S, we would have a very different air transportation system today, one that would be far less efficient and far less safe."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powering the microelectronics industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 193 nm projection photolithography technique has enabled the fabrication of every chip in every laptop, smartphone, military system, and data center for the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photolithography&amp;nbsp;uses light to print tiny patterns onto a silicon chip. The patterns are projected over a silicon wafer, which is coated with a chemical that changes its solubility when exposed to light. The soluble parts are etched out, leaving behind tiny structures that become the transistors and other devices on the chip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter wavelengths of light allow for printing smaller features, enabling more densely packed chips. By the 1980s, the accepted wisdom in the industry was that 248 nm was the shortest wavelength possible for photolithography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread skepticism and technical obstacles, Lincoln Laboratory pioneered photolithography at the 193 nm wavelength, fabricating the world's first microelectronic devices using the technique. The first-ever 193 nm projection system was installed at the laboratory in 1993. Soon after, the laboratory opened its doors to industrial partners to guide 193 nm semiconductor manufacturing and pave the way toward its widespread adoption. Today, it is the industry's mainstream technique and has enabled increasingly powerful integrated circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Photolithography at 193 nm has enabled the microelectronics industry to continue its path of miniaturization as charted by Moore's law, thus impacting every aspect of our increasingly digital lives. It is also a prime example of the impact that close collaborations between Lincoln Laboratory and industrial partners have had on society," says Mordechai Rothschild, who was one of the key developers of the 193 nm technique and today is a principal staff member in the Advanced Technology Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighting up a world of new technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fall 1962, General Electric, IBM, and Lincoln Laboratory each independently reported the first demonstrations of the semiconductor laser. In the 62 years since, it has become the most widespread laser in the world and a foundational element in a vast range of technologies: DVDs, CDs, computer mice, laser pointers, barcode scanners, medical imagers, and printers, to name a few. However, its greatest impact is arguably in communications. Every second, a semiconductor laser encodes information onto light that is transmitted through fiber-optic cables across oceans and into many homes, forming the backbone of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lasers were invented a few years earlier in 1960, the semiconductor type was exceptional because it realized all laser elements — light generation and amplification, lenses, and mirrors — within a piece of semiconducting material no bigger than a grain of rice. When injected with electrical current, the material is extremely efficient at converting the electrical energy to light. These attributes attracted the imagination of scientists and engineers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm pretty sure that we wouldn't be streaming movies to our homes or searching for the best restaurants from our phones without the low cost and manufacturability of semiconductor lasers," says Paul Juodawlkis, an expert in photonic devices and integrated circuits, and leader of the laboratory's Quantum Information and Integrated Nanosystems Group. "It's great to know that Lincoln Laboratory has played an important role in advancing this technology for government and commercial applications for the past 60-plus years and is poised to continue doing so in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honoring inventors and their legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 IEEE President-elect Kathleen Kramer presented the three awards to Lincoln Laboratory Director Eric Evans during the dedication ceremony. The ceremony was held in the auditorium at Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. Evans was joined on stage by inventors or their descendants to receive each plaque. Many Lincoln Laboratory staff and retirees who contributed to these innovations were also in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Orlando, who devoted his 50-year career at the laboratory to developing Mode S technology, joined Evans to accept that award. Mordechai Rothschild and David Shaver unveiled the 193 nm photolithography plaque. Both were lead developers of that technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, the ceremony was a touching celebration of their parent's legacy, and a return to fond memories. Richard Rediker, a son of semiconductor laser inventor Robert Rediker, recalled playing in a lab as a child with his father more than 60 years ago, the last time he visited Lincoln Laboratory. He accepted the semiconductor plaque alongside Susan Zeiger and Robert Lax, children of co-inventors Herbert Zeiger and Benjamin Lax respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was so rewarding to meet the other children of my father's colleagues and to fully appreciate what the inventions of our fathers mean to society today. Although my father passed away five years ago, this ceremony brought him back to life for an afternoon," says Rediker, adding that it was an experience he will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, these technologies have left an indelible mark on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"By celebrating the pride and prestige of our profession's contributions to history, we demonstrate how engineers, scientists, and technologists have contributed not only to our local communities, but also to our global community," Kramer said, before presenting the plaques. "It is my pleasure to recognize these pioneering events and people behind them. They serve as landmarks in the progress of technology and civilization."&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Angie Chatman | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After a week of &lt;a href="https://iceo.mit.edu/mlk-programs/annual-mlk-celebrations/" target="_blank"&gt;festivities&lt;/a&gt; around campus, members of the MIT community gathered Saturday evening in the Boston Marriott Kendall Square ballroom to celebrate the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. Marking 50 years of this annual celebration at MIT, the gala event’s program was loosely organized around a line in King’s essay, “The Purpose of Education,” which he penned as an undergraduate at Morehouse College:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must remember that intelligence is not enough,” King wrote. “Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Myles Noel was the master of ceremonies for the evening and welcomed one and all. Minister &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/dionetta-jones-crayton-change-maker-mit-0201" target="_blank"&gt;DiOnetta Jones Crayton&lt;/a&gt;, former director of the Office of Minority Education and associate dean of minority education, delivered the invocation, exhorting the audience to embrace “the fiery urgency of now.” Next, MIT President Sally Kornbluth shared her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She acknowledged that at many institutions, diversity and inclusion efforts are eroding. Kornbluth reiterated her commitment to these efforts, saying, “I want to be clear about how important I believe it is to keep such efforts strong — and to make them the best they can be. The truth is, by any measure, MIT has never been more diverse, and it has never been more excellent. And we intend to keep it that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kornbluth also recognized the late &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/paul-parravano-longtime-liaison-dies-1220" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Parravano&lt;/a&gt;, co-director of MIT’s Office of Government and Community Relations, who was a staff member at MIT for 33 years as well as the longest-serving member on the MLK Celebration Committee. Parravano’s “long and distinguished devotion to the values and goals of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. inspires us all,” Kornbluth said, presenting his family with the 50th Anniversary Lifetime Achievement Award.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, students and staff shared personal reflections. Zina Queen, office manager in the Department of Political Science, noted that her family has been a part of the MIT community for generations. Her grandmother, Rita, her mother, Wanda, and her daughter have all worked or are currently working at the Institute. Queen pointed out that her family epitomizes another of King’s oft-repeated quotes, “Every man is an heir to a legacy of dignity and worth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Tamea Cobb noted that MIT graduates have a particular power in the world that they must use strategically and with intention. “Education and service go hand and hand,” she said, adding that she intends “every one of my technical abilities will be used to pursue a career that is fulfilling, expansive, impactful, and good.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduate student Austin K. Cole ’24 addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict and the MIT administration. As he spoke, some attendees left their seats to stand with Cole at the podium. Cole closed his remarks with a plea to resist state and structural violence, and instead focus on relationship and mutuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, incoming vice president for equity and inclusion Karl Reid ’84, SM ’85 honored Adjunct Professor Emeritus Clarence Williams for his distinguished service to the Institute. Williams was an assistant to three MIT presidents, served as director of the Office of Minority Education, taught in the Department of Urban Planning, initiated the MIT Black History Project, and mentored hundreds of students. Reid was one of those students, and he shared a few of his mentor’s oft repeated phrases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do the work and let the talking take care of itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bad ideas kill themselves; great ideas flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, Reid exhorted the audience to create more leaders who, like Williams, embody excellence and mutual respect for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keynote address was given by civil rights activist Janet Moses, a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the 1960s; a physician who worked for a time as a pediatrician at MIT Health; a longtime resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts;&amp;nbsp;and a co-founder, with her husband, Robert Moses, of &lt;a href="https://algebra.org/wp/" target="_blank"&gt;the Algebra Project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a pioneering program grounded in the belief&amp;nbsp;“that in the 21st century every child has a civil right to secure math literacy — the ability to read, write, and reason with the symbol systems of mathematics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A striking image of a huge new building planned for New York City appeared on the screen behind Moses during her address. It was a rendering of a new jail being built at an estimated cost of $3 billion. Against this background, she described the trajectory of the “carceral state,” which began in 1771 with the Mansfield Judgement in England. At the time, “not even South Africa had a set of race laws as detailed as those in the U.S.,” Moses observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the carceral state uses all levels of government to maintain a racial caste system that is deeply entrenched, Moses argued, drawing a connection between the purported need for a new prison complex and a statistic that Black people in New York state are three times more likely than whites to be convicted for a crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She referenced a McKinsey study that it will take Black people over three centuries to achieve a quality of life on parity with whites. Despite the enormity of this challenge, Moses encouraged the audience to “rock the boat and churn the waters of the status quo.” She also pointed out that “there is joy in the struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symbols of joy were also on display at the Gala in the forms of original visual art and poetry, and a quilt whose squares were contributed by MIT staff, students, and alumni, hailing from across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quilts are a physical manifestation of the legacy of the enslaved in America and their descendants — the ability to take scraps and leftovers to create something both practical and beautiful. The 50th anniversary quilt also incorporated a line from King’s highly influential “I Have a Dream Speech”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One day, all God’s children will have the riches of freedom and the security of justice.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abhijit Banerjee, the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at MIT, and Sarnath Banerjee (no relation), an MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology (CAST) visiting artist share a similar background, but have very different ways of thinking. Both were raised for a time in Kolkata before leaving India to pursue divergent careers, Abhijit as an economist who went on to win the 2019 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (an award he shares with MIT Professor Esther Duflo and Harvard University Professor Michael Kremer), and Sarnath as a visual artist and graphic novelist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two collaborated on a pair of short films, “The Land of Good Intentions” and “The Eternal Swamp,” that blend their expertise in a unique and captivating form. Each film addresses a particular environmental crisis facing present-day India by tracing its origins back through the centuries. The films are presented in a kind of lecture style, with Abhijit appearing as the narrator, unraveling historical details, as graphics by Sarnath visualize the story with an often wry and easy wit. The results apply logic and narrative coherence to problems with complex roots in the forces of nature, economics, and local culture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Land of Good Intentions” explores the conditions and policies that led to mass protests by farmers, in Punjab and elsewhere, following the passage of farming legislation in September 2020. The film begins by providing historical context from multiple angles, including the significance of rice to regional culture, its growing conditions (which require a lot of water), the region’s climate (which produces very little), and previous government subsidies that led to its overproduction. The 2020 Farm Bills were intended to address rice overproduction and its consequences, including the depletion of Punjab’s groundwater supply, pollution from the burning of rice stalks, and a surplus going to waste. But farmers considered that they were being asked to shoulder the costs of a problem the government created.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The arguments in the film don’t necessarily align with popular liberal arguments, but it gives subtler shape and layers to them,” Sarnath says. “That dialectical way of thinking is important to the liberal movement, which is driven by passion and a sense of justice. Abhijit is driven by factual analysis, which sometimes makes the argument more complex.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their second film,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“The Eternal Swamp,” addresses the crisis of flooding in Kolkata and its causes in the geographical and economic development of the city from the start. Because Kolkata was built on very wet land, and real estate has long been one of the only viable industries in the city, it has been developed without regard to proper drainage in a climate that produces more rainfall than it can handle. There is a pervading sense that Kolkata will eventually be entirely below water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a good collaboration from the beginning,” Sarnath says of working with Abhijit on the CAST Visiting Artist project, a process which began just before Abhijit was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2019 and continued through the pandemic. “Both of us work on instinct, but the way he shapes an argument is very different from me,” Sarnath says. “My work does not follow a linear approach to telling a story; it’s fragmentary, driven by mood and emotion more than narrative, like composing a piece of music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they first met at a literary conference years ago, Abhijit and Sarnath have been close friends and intellectual sparring partners. Though Sarnath is based in Berlin and Abhijit in Boston, the two often cross paths in different locales and have long, ambling discussions that traverse a wide array of topics. “We spend a lot of time walking together wherever we find ourselves, whether it’s down the Longfellow Bridge in Boston or through Delhi or Kolkata,” Sarnath says. The idea for this project was born out of such conversations, in response to pressing events in their home country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abhijit wrote a proposal to MIT CAST, and the questions they received through the process helped them further shape the project. “It's important, when you have the luxury, just to spend time together. Thanks to MIT, we managed to do that across continents,” Sarnath says of their creative process. “It’s more than just telling a story; Abhijit unpacked what was in his head, and I drew and wrote a bit as well,” Sarnath says. And they worked with the editor and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;animator Niusha Ramzani, whom Sarnath says lent an Iranian aesthetic to the film’s animations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the format of the films, they wanted to capture the sense of a serene Bengali afternoon, with Abhijit seated in his home in Kolkata speaking in a relaxed tone. “We wanted it to be a bit like a Royal Society lecture,” Sarnath says, somewhat like a TED Talk but more personable and intimate. The aim was to make their complicated subjects more easily comprehensible, through the language of Abhijit’s narration and with the help of visual metaphors. Still, they did not want to sacrifice complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Economists are fabulists,” says Abhijit Banerjee. “We tell stories, simple stories, but that tends to get obscured in the telling, often because we like to be very careful about not overstating our case. Irony and the kind of playful humor that Sarnath brings to narration seemed to offer a different way to avoid being too emphatic, while allowing the story to be told in a way that it reaches a much larger audience. What is brilliant about Sarnath’s work is the play between reliable and the unreliable &lt;a&gt;— &lt;/a&gt;the readers are happy to be misdirected because they know that it will ultimately lead them where they want to be. I was hoping we could bring a little of that into economics.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to emancipate yourself from any one definitive answer,” Sarnath Banerjee says, describing&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Abhijit’s expansive way of thinking, through which he follows multiple thought processes to their logical conclusions. The result allows for ambiguity and contradiction, though the pathways of thinking are clear. The films illustrate the situations facing farmers in Punjab and the waterlogged streets of Kolkata by tracing their roots and examining the history of cause and effect. The results provide clarity, but no simple answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process was an enriching one for both of them, the kind of advancement in understanding that can only come in dialogue. “With each collaboration, you learn, and learning to me is an artistic form,” Sarnath says. “We are always learning.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Projects investigating Swahili, global media win SHASS Humanities Awards</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/shass-humanities-awards-0201</link>
  <description><![CDATA[The awards offer opportunities to expand research into unique areas of scholarship.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 13:50:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/shass-humanities-awards-0201</guid>
        <dc:creator>Benjamin Daniel | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two projects&amp;nbsp;— the Global Mediations Lab led by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/paul-roquet/" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Roquet&lt;/a&gt; and the MIT Swahili Studies Initiative led by &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/people/per-urlaub/" target="_blank"&gt;Per&amp;nbsp;Urlaub&lt;/a&gt; — have won &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/resources/internal/humanitiesawards"&gt;Humanities Awards&lt;/a&gt; from the MIT &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot program, launched in fall 2023, aims to support humanities-focused, collaborative projects that can have a broad impact within SHASS or MIT, or have a substantial impact on undergraduate education. Each winning project receives up to $100,000 in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Roquet: Investigating media and information impacts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Roquet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is the project lead for the Global Mediations Lab, which will enable a globe-spanning study of media texts, industries, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies, Roquet asserts, will reach beyond what he describes as “the usual focus on anglophone North America and Europe” to “map the global media landscape in its moments of contestation and transformation.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The big, difficult question here is how to enable a more fully global understanding of media technologies&amp;nbsp;— how these tools are used for good and ill, in ways both predictable and unforeseen,” he says. This work, he believes, can provide practitioners with context regarding the history and values feeding the exclusion of other ideas and perspectives. “We seek to understand how the spread of media is itself mediated by culture, place, politics, and history,” Roquet states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roquet will work alongside co-principal investigator &lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/paloma-duong/"&gt;Paloma Duong&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of Latin American studies in &lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing&lt;/a&gt; (CMS/W), and principal investigator &lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/ian-condry/"&gt;Ian Condry&lt;/a&gt;, professor of Japanese culture and media studies, CMS/W, and &lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;. They anticipate an integrated, diverse, and inclusive slate of events, conferences, and other efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it would also be great to experiment with other formats that take seriously our own media milieu, or that allow for more participatory collaborations and more process-oriented (versus outcome-oriented) forms of research and scholarship,” Duong says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team wants to develop, deliver, and maintain an expansive suite of operations that invites participation from across MIT and the world. Faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and MIT &lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/"&gt;Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program&lt;/a&gt; participants can benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roquet believes the Global Mediations Lab can serve as a hub for mapping how media practices transform as they spread around the world, and the importance of this understanding for work at MIT and among the broader community. “I want the Global Mediations Lab to be a venue for experimenting with how to bring global media insights more directly to bear on the understanding of media and technology,” Roquet says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Per Urlaub: Reexamining language studies and curricula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per (pronounced "pear") Urlaub, project lead of the MIT Swahili Studies Initiative, envisions a robust program scheduled during MIT’s annual &lt;a href="https://elo.mit.edu/iap/"&gt;Independent Activities Period&lt;/a&gt;. Urlaub and his colleagues want to offer students, colleagues, and staff the opportunity to study Swahili and associated cultures over the next five years throughout the academic year through co-curricular events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is an undeniable gap in MIT’s language curriculum — and this gap negatively impacts the ability of MIT undergraduate students to consider the perspectives of the African continent in their important work,” says Urlaub, who heads &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Global Languages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urlaub has enlisted the help of several colleagues from across multiple investigative areas at MIT to help plan and launch the Swahili studies program. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/lecturers/dina-asfaha"&gt;Dina Asfaha&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/"&gt;Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/joshua-bennett/"&gt;Joshua Bennett&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/"&gt;Literature&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/degraff/"&gt;Michel DeGraff&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/"&gt;Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/mai-hassan"&gt;Mai Hassan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/"&gt;Political Science&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/about/contact-us/staff-ari-jacobovits"&gt;Ari Jacobovits&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-africa"&gt;MIT-Africa&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/kenda-mutongi/#:~:text=Kenda%20Mutongi%20teaches%20a%20wide,(Chicago%20UP%2C%202007)."&gt;Kenda Mutongi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/"&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/norvin/"&gt;Norvin Richards&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/"&gt;Linguistics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/tavneet-suri"&gt;Tavneet Suri&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/danielle-wood/"&gt;Danielle Wood&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/"&gt;Aeronautics and Astronautics&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/graduate-program/about-media-arts-sciences/"&gt;Media Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urlaub selected Swahili for further study because “it’s one of the largest African languages, and arguably the language that has currently the most significant momentum in terms of growth and impact.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swahili, Urlaub notes, has been spoken primarily in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique, but the total number of Swahili speakers, be they native or second-language speakers, is estimated to be around 200 million.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In recent decades, the language has developed into a lingua franca across Eastern Africa, competing successfully for this status with English,” Urlaub continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swahili’s growing influence is evident in its ubiquity across a substantial swath of the African continent, widely used in the African Great Lakes region, East and Southern Africa, some parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, the southern tip of Somalia, and Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urlaub highlights the value of &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/"&gt;language education&lt;/a&gt; at MIT while also acknowledging what he describes as “the enduring impact of colonialism on language and cultural studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe we owe the MIT community opportunities to broaden their intellectual horizons toward the African continent,” Urlaub says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urlaub wants students to appreciate the complex and fascinating linguistic landscape of African countries, including the implications of the dominance of Swahili language for other regional languages. He further seeks expanded opportunities for student and faculty access to African nations’ rich historical and cultural tapestries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT students’ opportunities to engage with Africa are reduced to either mono-linguistic exchanges in English, or through other languages in our current curriculum that were introduced to the continent through military conquest and colonial exploitation, like French, Portuguese, and Arabic,” Urlaub continues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Urlaub values the investigation of language as a key element in cross-disciplinary understanding for future leaders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MIT students gravitate to us because many recognize the value of linguistic and intercultural skills as tools that will empower them to address some of the world’s most urgent challenges by collaborating with partners around the world,” Urlaub asserts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Minicourse open to the MIT community gives context to the Middle East crisis</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT community members can learn more about the Israel-Hamas conflict through a recently developed online course organized by Middle East and North Africa (MENA)/MIT at MIT’s Center for International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three-session course, titled “Israel, Palestine, Gaza before and after October 7: Understanding historical context and contrasting narratives,” was first held between Nov. 29 and Dec. 13. More than 500 community members attended those sessions, including students, faculty, staff, and alumni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course instructor is Peter Krause PhD ’11, an associate professor of political science at Boston College who is also a research affiliate in MIT’s Security Studies Program and an expert on Middle East politics. Krause spent multiple years living in the region to conduct interviews with Israelis and Palestinians for his dissertation and first book, which focused on the history of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to create a jumping off point for constructive discussions in the MIT community,” Krause says. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;I want people in the community to be able to have more engaging and informed discussions with each other. Providing this knowledge can allow people to understand each other better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We all could use more understanding”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions were split up into the history of Israelis, Palestinians, and their national movements; conflicts and peace in the region between 1948 and 2023; and a look at the current conflict and the future of Israeli-Palestinian relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next session of the course will feature recordings of the first three sessions as well as a live Q&amp;amp;A with Krause, and will run between Dec. 18 and Jan. 3. Community members can &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffQiG8czWy3teimOJ8MhgH9vcF6YeAzdECOvFtPpoSivY9UQ/viewform" target="_blank"&gt;register with their MIT email address&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1,100 community members registered for the first session, including many alumni and faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t worry too much about headcount; I think even if we impact a small number of people, but impact them deeply, that can change the world,” says Associate Professor Richard Nielsen, MENA/MIT Faculty Director who is also member of the Security Studies Program and was involved in creating the course. “That said, a sizeable portion of the MIT community is seeking more information on these topics. We all could use more understanding and more ideas about this conflict. MIT is all ideas. When we think about making an impact at MIT, it has to be through education.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause says he sought to provide context to the daily news updates on the conflict and to counter what he calls the “junk food information” snippets common on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building empathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the most important things that I hope comes out of these sessions is the building of empathy,” Krause says, which is why he focused the sessions on the narratives of Palestinian and Israelis, not just events. “I think if you have the ability to put yourself in other people’s shoes and in some small way understand what they’re experiencing and how they see things, that’s the basis for more positive engagement, not just in the MIT community but at large.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krause acknowledged that many community members aren’t able to take a semester-length course on this complex subject. The condensed course tries to accurately depict not just one Israeli perspective or one Palestinian perspective, but the range of opinions within each of those communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When you start to break it down and show the diversity of opinion and experiences on each side, not only does that deepen understanding, but you also start to see the real stakes and the real people behind the news headlines,” Krause says. “I think that’s really important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional sessions with new updates are also being planned in February. The course is one of the Institute’s many initiatives aimed at bringing a deeper level of understanding to the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I hope whatever attendees’ political preferences are, they can learn from this, which will ground whatever feelings they have in greater knowledge,” Krause explains. “I believe greater knowledge is going to lead to not just greater understanding, but also better research, better policy, and then hopefully better relationships with people around us, because we understand each other more.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disputes over mining were common in late imperial China, during the Qing Dynasty. For instance, in the 1870s, Wu Tang, the governor-general of Sichuan province, enacted an outright ban on mining, despite an apparent economic need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rationale Wu Tang and other mining opponents often used to support their decisions? Fengshui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right, fengshui, the same concept contemporary Westerners associate with interior design — although it was a rather different thing in its place of origin. Fengshui was not a guide to sofa placement, but a long-established body of Chinese knowledge about the natural environment in relationship to the constructed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fengshui literally means wind and water,” says MIT historian Tristan Brown. “I think you can define it as an ever-evolving knowledge system of the natural and built environment that applied cosmological principles to the analysis of land for the siting of significant projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown has written a new book about this rich and overlooked past, “Laws of the Land: Fengshui and the State in Qing Dynasty China,” published this month by Princeton University Press. In it, he examines the place of fengshui in Chinese society, specifically as a doctrine of knowledge used to inform legal cases and public policy decisions at a time of industrialization and modernization. In this sense, fengshui was not a matter of private taste, but a crucial part of the public sphere. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a government report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a firmly codified body of thought, fengshui involves the elemental forces of yin and yang, which interact to create the “five agents,” with the qualities of fire, water, metal, wood, and earth. These are the basic parts of qi, the vital essence of the world. In China, there were two dominant modes of fengshui: the Compass School, which used a geomatic compass to assess the placement of structures, and the Form School, which focused more on the overall balance of built sites within the larger forms of the natural landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Laws of the Land” is the end product of doctoral work by Brown, who is the S.C. Fang Chinese Language and Culture Career Development Professor in MIT’s history section. Through original archival research in China, he analyzed hundreds of legal cases using fengshui, often involving the placement of gravesites, houses, temples, palaces, mining, industrial construction, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wu Tang, for one, ordered the Chengdu Plain of the Sichuan basin to be mapped by geomantic compass, creating a body of knowledge he could use in legal and policy matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is like a federal government report today in trying to debate a pipeline question, [it details] where the key places are, where everything is,” Brown says. “You can read that map as a super-fascinating specimen in the history of law and the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as Brown emphasizes, the use of fengshui in public matters, occasionally remarked on by Westerners as a kind of eccentricity, was a recognizable effort to find sources of authority during disagreements about modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These Qing officials were not naïve, they were not backwards, including the ones who invoked fengshui to say [changes were] going to be bad,” Brown says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while explaining how fengshui was deployed in these cases, “Laws of the Land” also provides insights about industrialization in China. Some of the clearest disputes involving fengshui were concerned foreign investment in railroads, the telegraph, and mining in the late 19th century. But as Brown’s work shows, economic growth was creating pressures and public disputes well before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the 19th century, prior to railways and telegraphs even being debated, there was a rising population in China, there was increasing pressure on local environments, and the government was really just trying to hang on,” Brown says. “It’s a society and a legal system coming to terms with dramatic environmental and economic change, and trying to negotiate those shifts in the law through fengshui.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From mining to the living room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Laws of the Land” may also put the contemporary, Westernized, scaled-down version of fengshui into better perspective. Many Westerners encountered fengshui as part of the global rise in interest in Asian culture that dates back about 50 or 60 years. The scale and ambition of fengshui has certainly changed, compared to the way it was originally practiced in China, and Brown’s book helps show what has evolved, and remained intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Fengshui gets rediscovered in the 1960s and the 1970s in the West as a kind of New Age knowledge, for harmonizing the environment with human beings, harmonizing living spaces, eventually living rooms and kitchens and all of that,” Brown says. “I think this book can also show how fengshui got where it is today, why it appears in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in the design section. There is a long history of people engaging fengshui and not necessarily knowing what it is, but this book may help clarify that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Laws of the Land” has received praise from other historians. Jonathan Schlesinger, an Indiana University historian who studies both the Qing dynasty and environmental issues, has called it “an impressive, fine-combed reading of sources that paint a vivid picture of fengshui’s signature importance within local life and Qing law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown says he hopes to draw a wide audience of people with a variety of interests, given that his book brings together ideas about Chinese history, the law, design, religion and spirituality, and more. Academically, studying fengshui was once the province of anthropologists, but Brown’s book places the subject in new terrain as a part of legal history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The book builds on what’s come before and I hope contributes to what’s coming next,” Brown says. “For readers, and for students and scholars of architecture, design, law, religion, the environment, I hope there’s something here for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>3 Questions: Wiebke Denecke on a landmark project for Chinese literature</title>

  <description><![CDATA[The Hsu-Tang Library of Classical Chinese Literature brings three millennia of classic texts to the world, in bilingual editions.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nuns writing fine poetry. Centuries-old joke books. An epic travelogue ending with a visit to Genghis Khan. These are just a few things readers can experience through the new Hsu-Tang Library of Classical Chinese Literature, published by Oxford University Press. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The series is modeled on the Loeb Classical Library, which debuted in 1912 and features about 500 titles of Greek and Roman literature, in their distinctive red and green covers. The Hsu-Tang Library of Classical Chinese Literature series is starting with five titles, under the supervision of founding editor-in-chief Wiebke Denecke, the S. C. Fang Professor of Chinese Language and Culture in MIT’s literature section. The aim is to bring these classic texts, from the first millennium BCE through the early 20th century, to the world, in engaging bilingual editions. There will be four more new titles next year, with dozens lined up after that. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The series benefactors are Oscar Liu-Chien Tang and Agnes Hsin Mei Hsu-Tang, whose family has also been MIT benefactors and has a notable record of philanthropy for institutions and programs in the arts, humanities, and education. &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; talked with Denecke about the ambitious new book series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the Hsu-Tang Library of Classical Chinese Literature?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a library of classical Chinese literature, covering three millennia, from what is now China and from many other places. Just as Latin was the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; in Europe, classical Chinese was the &lt;em&gt;lingua franca&lt;/em&gt; of writers in East Asia, so we include authors from Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The editions are bilingual, Chinese on one side of the page and English on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It belongs to a certain type of project that you could call endowed bilingual libraries. This started 100 years ago with the &lt;a href="https://www.loebclassics.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Loeb Classical Library&lt;/a&gt; of classic Greco-Roman literature. A decade ago, the Murty Classical Library of India was launched, and now here we have a new library of classical Chinese literature. It is a great moment for world literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We publish translations that are both solidly scholarly and eminently readable. Our associate editor is Lucas Klein, who has a vision of literary magic that makes words sparkle — it’s something he has really emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our donors, Agnes Hsin Mei Hsu-Tang and Oscar Liu-Chien Tang, are particularly interesting. Agnes Hsu-Tang is the descendant of Xu Guangqi, who was co-translator with Matteo Ricci, an Italian Jesuit missionary in the 17th century, of Euclid’s “Elements.” Agnes has another great ancestor, Ji Yun, who compiled one of the greatest encyclopedias of the world, in the 18th century. It’s not just somebody from the Chinese world supporting this, but there’s a family lineage of translating knowledge onto a global stage, a symbol of East-West cultural exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What can we discover, or rediscover, about Chinese-language literature through this library?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s an important moment for the humanities generally. The Loeb Library was established when James Loeb himself said the humanities were being neglected more than at any time since perhaps the Middle Ages. Overall, we have a three-pronged strategy: First, we try to make the canonical new. Then we go beyond what anglophone readers might have heard about Chinese literature. For instance, we have three joke collections, in “The Misadventures of Master Mugwort.” In China, joke collections were very popular, and there’s a lot of political satire in there. But there is a common prejudice that China lacks satirical literature. Third, the series emphasizes that there is more than 2,000 years of common cultural heritage in East Asia. That’s a real message right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We publish works that are very surprising, such as “An Anthology of Poetry by Buddhist Nuns of Late Imperial China.” Many of these are first translations. We wanted a voice of the female experience, often in very precarious times. Some nuns were from elite ranks and had lost their husbands. Others were orphaned. It’s a real archaeology of female voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very good antidote to the idea that nuns were confined. Quite to the contrary, they made relationships they never could have in a household. They were writing poetry and painting, and it’s very empowering. One such example is Shangjian Huizong’s 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century poem, “Village Life.” Her husband died in prison, and she wrote three volumes of poetry, including these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Living here impoverished / I’ve lost all taste for ornaments … / The face of the woman in my mirror / is a flower that knows emptiness”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is amazing here? Obviously as a nun she was impoverished. The ornaments are hair ornaments, and it goes with a literary tradition in China to write about women in a boudoir — usually written by males, but here the boudoir implies self-reflectivity. The flower is a natural ornament; it also knows that emptiness accompanies the idea of enlightenment, in the Buddhist sense. So, she turns around boudoir imagery, saying she realizes in the symbolic mirror that she has gained enlightenment. These lines have incredible literary value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Another one of the first five volumes is “Daoist Master Changchun’s Journey to the West,” a firsthand account of a visit to Genghis Khan by a Chinese traveling party on a long diplomatic trip. Surely there are not many texts like this. What is it about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; This is written by a disciple of a Daoist patriarch who was summoned by Genghis Khan in the 1220s, when the Mongols were rushing through the continent. They basically emerged from nowhere, didn’t have a lot of history or writing behind them, and shaped world history. There are so few eyewitness sources, it’s amazing to have a travelogue with so much detail. It’s also made special by all the poetry in it, which in the Chinese tradition was always the main medium of experiencing reality and expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this text, poetry becomes a way to cope with this travel experience: You start in China, go to Central Asia, like to the city of Samarkind, and encounter different people, different plants, Islam, sweet melons, and people drinking from glass vessels never seen in China. It’s a way to familiarize and exoticize at the same time. And the writer observes a person — we know today it’s a &lt;em&gt;muezzin&lt;/em&gt; — lead in “petitioning heaven” for the Muslim prayer. This is an encounter with Islam, though he doesn’t have a real concept of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Genghis Khan is intensely interested in the Dao — or at least that’s how it’s depicted. The first three times they meet, the conversation is always about the Dao. The Chinese want to believe the other side is interested in them. Finally, this is also hagiographic text, a sacred eulogy of this patriarch, and it’s a process of getting political capital out of the connections with Genghis Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all of this, we are really trying to develop what we call the Hsu-Tang Library style: smartly scholarly, where you feel there’s something gained in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Judgment, reason, and the university</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT’s Malick Ghachem extends the “Dialogues across Differences” lecture series with a talk about the past and present of university politics. ]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/judgment-reason-and-university-1122</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At a time when universities are subject to intense political pressure, it is tempting to think they can follow a template for establishing to all concerned that educational institutions are neutral entities. But circumstances will almost always complicate such efforts, MIT Professor Malick Ghachem suggested in a recent public lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk focused on the Kalven Report, a widely cited 1967 University of Chicago document heralding neutrality as a goal for institutions of higher education. While that may often be desirable as a pragmatic goal, Ghachem observed, there is no absolute, immutable condition of neutrality that can be achieved by complex institutions. Instead, sound institutional positioning requires reasonable judgment, applied again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For higher education leaders in today’s world, Ghachem noted, who are often implored to comment on civic and global matters, “There is no way to avoid saying something. The issue is, what do you say, how, and how often.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghachem’s lecture, titled “Neutrality, Diversity, and the University,” was part of an MIT event series, “Dialogues Across Difference: Building Community at MIT.” In it, Ghachem, the head of MIT’s History Section, detailed the history of the Kalven Report, which was rooted in Vietnam War-era protests at the University of Chicago. The talk outlined the differing views that existed among its creators and offered further thoughts about the dynamics of seeking neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Neutrality is an unstable value,” Ghachem said, noting that professing a goal of neutrality can be deployed as a tactic by people with their own aims and agendas. Indeed, Ghachem added, the idea of neutrality can start “veering off into a nonneutral direction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even in seemingly routine, everyday matters, institutions are often faced with choices about funding and support that may never be viewed as value-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When values and the expenditure of money collide, a decision has to be made,” said Ghachem. “And at that moment, neutrality, or honor, or whatever it is, are not going to tell what the answer is. No report will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The community dialogue was held in MIT’s Samberg Conference Center on Oct. 26 and also shown via webcast. The event was co-sponsored by the offices of the President, Provost, and Chancellor at MIT. Interim Deputy Institute Community and Equity Officer Tracie Jones-Barrett served as a moderator for a question-and-answer session following the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghachem was introduced by MIT Provost Cynthia Barnhart, who called the talk part of the “essential work of cultivating civil discourse, critical thinking, and empathy among members of the MIT community.” She also noted that the event series was “one of many activities our staff, faculty, and students are working on to foster the respectful exchange of viewpoints.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghachem is both a trained historian and lawyer; he has a BA in history and a JD from Harvard University, and earned his MA and PhD in history from Stanford University. A leading scholar of slavery and abolition in the Atlantic world, as well as legal and constitutional history, he is the author of “The Old Regime and the Haitian Revolution” (Cambridge University Press, 2012).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The historical background for the Kalven Report is the Vietnam War, especially the period of student protest following the U.S. government decision to roll back the S-2 student draft deferment rule. That embroiled the University of Chicago and many other institutions in significant contention on campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kalven Report, Ghachem said, “embodies a dream of the American university as a space where minds can be free because no one is told what they can or must think.” In the report’s view, the university houses social critics — faculty and students — without itself functioning as a critic; heavy-handed institutional positions would threaten the diversity of viewpoints, in the report’s estimation. The report suggests overturning the stance of neutrality for only a couple of reasons: threats to the university’s mission as a site of free inquiry, and times when the university is acting in its corporate capacity (such as legal matters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, Ghachem noted, the committee members that worked on the Kalven Report — it is named after its chair, Harry Kalven, a first amendment legal scholar — had varying views about the matter. The eminent historian John Hope Franklin, Ghachem observed, believed we “cannot be indifferent to the disorders and defects in our society that are themselves opposed to its [the university’s] existence as a free intellectual community.” Jacob Getzels, an education professor, warned that the idea of “neutrality” had aided the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany. Gilbert White, a professor of geography and former president of Haverford College, contended it was important for universities to actively “model ethical action,” Ghachem explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From still another perspective, the prominent economist George Stigler contended that the sum total of individual actions and views would create a kind of civic equivalent of the “general equilibrium” modeled in market economics, thus providing sufficient balance and rendering institutional views less necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Ghachem, this disagreement within the Kalven Report committee, and the possible range of ethical stances it encompassed, was glossed over in the final report and is largely and wrongly overlooked today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Kalven Report is an obscuring of real differences that existed among the committee [members] who made up that report,” Ghachem said. “That is why we are struggling with this ideal today. Because we don’t fully acknowledge the extent of the disagreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghachem suggested there were a few other shortcomings of the Kalven Report, or at least the way we think about it today. For one thing, referencing the intellectual historian Quentin Skinner, Ghachem noted that, in effect, nothing really exists outside of history; the idea of neutrality will always be set with reference to the politics of its era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also may be unclear who at a university is thought to speak for that institution, as Ghachem outlined. Beyond that, he noted, many different kinds of universities may exist, some oriented explicitly around certain priorities that make political neutrality on all issues less of an institutional North Star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all of this, Ghachem added, when assessing the Kalven Report, we can still “treat it as a model even if it’s philosophically very problematic.” An institution can move toward balance and fairness at all times, without expecting to achieve a perpetual, self-sustaining state of neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a question-and-answer session following his remarks, Ghachem said he strongly agreed that it is important for university members to speak up against political interference — such as state government leaders trying to control curriculum and content decisions at public universities, schools, and libraries. Such a view is also aligned with the Kalven Report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our very mission as a university is bound up with the fate of other universities in the United States,” Ghachem said, adding that he thinks “it’s appropriate for universities to stand up for shared university values.” For instance, he observed, “If we don’t say something about curriculum, then there’s really nothing left for us to stick up for.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answering audience questions, Ghachem again underlined the practical value of aiming for something like neutrality in “prudential” everyday terms, rather than thinking of it as a philosophical condition one might enter into. For instance, aiming for balance can often serve scholars and students well in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I try to model a version of the Kalven Report as an instructor,” Ghachem said. “I don’t cite it. But the ethos that it tries to evoke, as a prudential matter, that’s what I try to do, because I think that’s the best way for students to have discussions. And as scholar I try to do the same thing, in the sense that if there are people I disagree with in the field, I feel like I want to read what they say, and understand and learn from it, and respond to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A civil discourse on climate change</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/civil-discourse-climate-change-1120</link>
  <description><![CDATA[A recent forum was the first in a series planned at MIT this year, part of an initiative meant to encourage the open exchange of ideas.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new MIT initiative designed to encourage open dialogue on campus kicked off with a conversation focused on how to address challenges related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Climate Change: Existential Threat or Bump in the Road” featured Steve Koonin, theoretical physicist and former U.S. undersecretary for science during the Obama administration, and Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at MIT. A crowd of roughly 130 students, staff, and faculty gathered in an MIT lecture hall for the discussion on Tuesday, Oct. 24.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The bump is strongly favored,” Koonin said when the talk began, referring to his contention that climate change was a “bump in the road” rather than an existential threat. After proposing a future in which we could potentially expect continued growth in America’s gross domestic product despite transportation and infrastructure challenges related to climate change, he concluded that investments in nuclear energy and capacity increases related to storing wind- and solar-generated energy could help mitigate climate-related phenomena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emanuel, while mostly agreeing with Koonin’s assessment of climate challenges and potential solutions, cautioned against underselling the threat of human-aided climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Humanity’s adaptation to climate stability hasn’t prepared us to effectively manage massive increases in temperature and associated effects,” he argued. “We’re poorly adapted to less-frequent events like those we’re observing now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decarbonization, Emanuel noted, can help mitigate global conflicts related to fossil fuel usage. “Carbonization kills between 8 and 9 million people annually,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation on climate change is one of several planned on campus this academic year. The &lt;a href="https://civildiscourse.mit.edu/?page_id=123" target="_blank"&gt;speaker series&lt;/a&gt; is one part of “&lt;a href="http://civildiscourse.mit.edu/"&gt;Civil Discourse in the Classroom and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;,” an initiative being led by MIT philosophers Alex Byrne and Brad Skow. The two-year project is meant to encourage the open exchange of ideas inside and outside college and university classrooms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker series pairs external thought leaders with MIT faculty to encourage the interrogation and debate of all kinds of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding common ground&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the talk on climate change, both Koonin and Emanuel recommended a slow and steady approach to mitigation efforts, reminding attendees that, for example, developing nations can’t afford to take a developed world approach to climate change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These people have immediate needs to meet,” Koonin reminded the audience, “which can include fossil fuel use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Koonin and Emanuel recommended a series of steps to assist with both climate change mitigation and effective messaging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sustain and improve climate science&amp;nbsp;— continue to investigate and report findings.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improve climate communications for non-experts&amp;nbsp;— tell an easy-to-understand and cohesive story.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Focus on reliability and affordability before mitigation&amp;nbsp;— don’t undertake massive efforts that may disrupt existing energy transmission infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adopt a “graceful” approach to decarbonization&amp;nbsp;— consider impacts as broadly as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Don’t constrain energy supply in the developing world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Increase focus on developing and delivering alternative responses&amp;nbsp; — consider the potential ability to scale power generation, and delivery methods like nuclear energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitigating climate risk requires political will, careful consideration, and an improved technical approach to energy policy, both concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have to learn to deal rationally with climate risk in a polarized society,” Koonin offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience asked both speakers questions about impacts on nonhuman species (“We don’t know but we should,” both shared); nuclear fusion (“There isn’t enough tritium to effectively scale the widespread development of fusion-based energy; perhaps in 30 to 40 years,” Koonin suggested); and the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1259855#:~:text=The%20planetary%20boundaries%20framework%20defines,stability%20of%20the%20Earth%20system."&gt;planetary boundaries framework&lt;/a&gt; (“There’s good science underway in this space and I’m curious to see where it’s headed,” said Emanuel.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The event was a great success,” said Byrne, afterward. “The audience was engaged, and there was a good mix of faculty and students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One surprising thing,” Skow added, “was both Koonin and Emanuel were down on wind and solar power, [especially since] the idea that we need to transition to both is certainly in the air.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More conversations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second speaker series event, held earlier this month, was “Has Feminism Made Progress?” with Mary Harrington, author of “Feminism Against Progress,” and Anne McCants, MIT professor of history. An additional discussion planned for spring 2024 will cover the public health response to Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions from the speaker series will appear as special episodes on “The Good Fight,” a podcast hosted by Johns Hopkins University political scientist Yascha Mounk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Discourse project is made possible due, in part, to funding from the &lt;a href="https://www.avdf.org/"&gt;Arthur Vining Davis Foundations&lt;/a&gt; and a collaboration between the MIT History Section and &lt;a href="http://concourse.mit.edu/"&gt;Concourse&lt;/a&gt;, a program featuring an integrated, cross-disciplinary approach to investigating some of humanity’s most interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Discourse initiative includes two components: the speaker series open to the MIT community, and seminars where students can discuss freedom of expression and develop skills for successfully engaging in civil discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 11 faculty were granted tenure in the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/isaiah-andrews"&gt;Isaiah Andrews&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’14 is a professor in the Department of Economics. He is an econometrician who develops reliable and broadly applicable methods of statistical inference to address key challenges in economics, social science, and medicine. He is the recipient of the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal, a MacArthur Fellowship, and a Sloan Research Fellowship. Andrews earned his PhD in economics from MIT and served as an assistant and associate professor in the Department of Economics from 2016 to 2018. He returned to MIT as a full professor in 2023 after spending five years at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/joshua-bennett/"&gt;Joshua Bennett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a professor in the MIT Literature Section and Distinguished Chair of the Humanities. He is the author of five books of poetry, criticism, and narrative nonfiction, including most recently "Spoken Word: A Cultural History" (Knopf, 2023) and&lt;em&gt; "&lt;/em&gt;The Study of Human Life" (Penguin, 2022), which is being adapted for television in collaboration with Warner Brothers Studios. He earned his PhD in English from Princeton University, and an MA in theater and performance studies from the University of Warwick, where he was a Marshall Scholar. For his creative writing and scholarship, Bennett has received fellowships and awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Whiting Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Society of Fellows at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/megan-a-black/"&gt;Megan Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the MIT History Section. She is a historian of U.S. environmental management and foreign relations in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Her interests span the fields of environmental history, foreign relations history, history of capitalism, science and technology studies, and histories of the U.S. West. She is the author of "The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power," which analyzes the surprising role of the U.S. Department of the Interior in pursuing minerals around the world&amp;nbsp;— in Indigenous lands, formal territories, foreign nations, the oceans, and outer space. The work garnered four prizes in different subfields. Professor Black previously taught at the London School of Economics and completed postdoctoral fellowships at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University and the John Sloane Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College. She earned her BA from the University of Nebraska and her PhD from George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/william-deringer/"&gt;William Deringer&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. His research examines the history of those techniques and technologies of calculation that organize modern economic, financial, and political life. His work ranges widely across time, from early compound-interest tables and changing social relations in the English countryside in the early 1600s to the place of computer spreadsheets in the culture of Wall Street in the “go-go” 1980s. Deringer received his BA summa cum laude in history from Harvard University in 2006, and his MA (2009) and PhD (2012) in history of science from Princeton University. Before graduate school, he was an investment banking analyst at the Blackstone Group in New York. At Princeton, he was awarded the Porter Ogden Jacobus Fellowship, Princeton’s highest honor for graduate students. From 2012 to 2015, he was a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University, before joining the MIT faculty in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/green/"&gt;E.J. Green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy and the Class of 1948 Career Development Chair. He joined the MIT faculty in 2017. He received his PhD from Rutgers University in 2016, then spent a year as a postdoc at New York University before arriving at MIT. His research interests are in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science, with a primary focus on perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nathaniel-hendren"&gt;Nathaniel Hendren&lt;/a&gt; PhD ’12 is a professor in the Department of Economics. His research quantifies the differences in economic mobility and opportunity for people of different backgrounds, explores why private markets often fail to provide economic opportunity, and offers new tools for government policymakers evaluating the effectiveness of social programs. Hendren founded and co-directs Policy Impacts and Opportunity Insights. He has received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and a Sloan Research Fellowship. Hendren earned his PhD in economics from MIT and returned as a full professor in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/caley-horan/"&gt;Caley Horan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an associate professor in the History Section. She is an historian of the 20th century United States interested in the social life of economic ideas. Her research and teaching focus on business history and the history of capitalism, risk and uncertainty, and American culture in the post-1945 era. Her first book "Insurance Era: Risk, Governance, and the Privatization of Security in Postwar America,"&amp;nbsp;won the 2022 Hagley Prize for best book in business history. "Insurance Era&lt;em&gt;"&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;examines the role of the insurance industry in shaping social, political, and economic life in the United States during the second half of the 20th century. Horan is currently at work on a new project on the history of astrology and uncertainty in the modern United States. She earned her BA from Stanford University in 2003, and her PhD from the University of Minnesota in 2011.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/robin-scheffler/"&gt;Robin Wolfe Scheffler&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. He is an historian of the modern biological and biomedical sciences and their intersections with developments in American history. The common aim of his projects is to show the mutual influence of society on science and science on society. His first book, "A Contagious Cause: The American Hunt for Cancer Viruses and the Rise of Molecular Medicine," follows the history of cancer virus research from laboratory to legislature, showing the intimate connections between health policy and the emergence of a molecular vision of life. He is currently at work on a National Science Foundation-supported project to write the first history of the Boston-area biotechnology cluster and the spatial relationships between technological innovation and the production of inequality. He earned undergraduate degrees in history and chemistry from the University of Chicago, an M.Phil in the history and philosophy of science from the University of Cambridge, and a doctorate from Yale University in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/frank-schilbach"&gt;Frank&amp;nbsp;Schilbach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an associate professor in the Department of Economics. He researches the relationship between poverty and economic behavior by investigating factors such as mental distress, sleep deprivation, and substance use. He also studies behavioral barriers to the diffusion of information in developing countries. Schilbach is an affiliate at the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), the Centre for Economic Policy Research, and the Bureau for Research and Economic Analysis of Development, and he helps lead the&amp;nbsp;Behavioral Development Lab&amp;nbsp;in India. Schilbach joined the Department of Economics in 2015 after earning his PhD in economics from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/caitlin-talmadge"&gt;Caitlin Talmadge&lt;/a&gt; PhD '11 is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science. She also serves as a senior nonresident fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution; a member of the Defense Policy Board at the U.S. Department of Defense; and a series editor for Cornell Studies in Security Affairs at Cornell University Press. During the academic year 2023-24, she is on leave from MIT as a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington. Talmadge’s research and teaching focus on nuclear deterrence and escalation, U.S. military operations and strategy, and security issues in Asia and the Persian Gulf. Talmadge is a graduate of Harvard University (BA, government, summa cum laude) and MIT (PhD, political science). Previously, she has worked as a researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; a consultant to the Office of Net Assessment at the U.S. Department of Defense; and a professor at the George Washington University and Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/leslie-tilley"&gt;Leslie Tilley&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Music and Theater Arts Section. She is a music analyst and ethnomusicologist whose interests in musical transformation span a wide spectrum of areas and approaches, from ethnographically-based music analyses of collective improvisations in Bali, Indonesia, to comparative, multi-modal analyses of cover songs. Her book, "Making it up Together: The Art of Collective Improvisation in Balinese Music and Beyond," (University of Chicago Press) presents close analyses of the Balinese improvised forms reyong norot and kendang arja while offering broad-reaching analytical frameworks for examining improvisation and collective creativity across genres and cultures. The book won the Society for Music Theory Emerging Scholar Award in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Centering feminism</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/centering-feminism-lerna-ekmekcioglu-1107</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Professor Lerna Ekmekcioglu investigates marginalized women and potential empowerment.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 13:40:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/centering-feminism-lerna-ekmekcioglu-1107</guid>
        <dc:creator>Benjamin Daniel | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There’s a black-and-white photo from a 1920s beauty pageant in a gilt frame hanging above the desk in MIT Professor Lerna Ekmekcioglu’s office. The Jazz Age image features white flapper girls in white dresses. There’s an unsettling commonality among the women in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I found this at a garage sale,” Ekmekcioglu recalls, “and thought it neatly encapsulated my evolving view of feminist thought, at least for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the office, leaning on a wall near the entrance, is a piece of white backing board on which are pasted a series of images. The highly influential feminist publication and women’s journal, &lt;a href="https://agbuwebtalks.org/page/armenian-feminists-hayganush-mark-and-hay-gin"&gt;“Hay Gin,” and its founder and editor, Hayganush Mark&lt;/a&gt;, are at the collage’s core, surrounded by images of socially marginalized women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and political distance between those pictures is part of a fascinating journey for Ekmekcioglu and her research into a feminism that centers both her &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/67281295/Of_Dark_Pasts_and_Pipe_Dreams_The_Turkish_University"&gt;Turkish-Armenian heritage&lt;/a&gt; and underrepresented women across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On investigating identity at the sociopolitical margins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Ekmekcioglu, MIT’s McMillan-Stewart Associate Professor of History, the director of MIT’s &lt;a href="http://wgs.mit.edu/"&gt;Program in Women’s and Gender Studies,&lt;/a&gt; and a professor since 2011, credits a focus on the work of leading feminists like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/books/bell-hooks-dead.html"&gt;bell hooks&lt;/a&gt;, her investigation of Turkish-Armenian feminism’s foundation, connections between those feminists, and scholarship among other members of underserved populations for her continuing education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a shared set of experiences among groups of people with dark pasts,” she asserts. “What happens to marginalized groups within marginalized groups?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens, Ekmekcioglu says, is these people live with multiple dilemmas: opposition to patriarchy and inequality while also committed to their “grouphood,” the shared experiences. “Grouphood relies on traditions, and many traditions are patriarchal and ascribe only a certain, limited set of rights and responsibilities to women,” she continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On barriers to inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekmekcioglu’s work derives, in part, from a desire to understand the sociopolitical support for marginalization across some cultures and, more broadly, to understand the world around her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to understand the history of people like me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people, she notes, are Indigenous feminists and others whose identities are rooted in systems that prioritize patriarchy. These identities, she notes, are historically difficult for women to occupy. In an age of “Me Too,” her work connects these research threads into a vast and colorful tapestry spanning many years. Distinct communities like feminists, she notes, have their roots in nationalism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Feminism is a derivative of nationalism,” Ekmekcioglu continues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a through line Ekmekcioglu traces from the intersection of the multiple identities women occupy to the calls for restorative justice roiling several of the world’s underserved communities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On building alliances and investigating solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about how to overcome the challenges feminists face, Ekmekcioglu recommends ongoing study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The barriers persist,” she says, “but I think it helps to develop scholarship, create awareness, and make alliances among people doing this work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekmekcioglu also notes that people holding tightly to power is historically part of the human condition. The community of scholars that have risen from marginalized communities continues the work of shrinking the distance between the 1920s flapper girl beauty contestants and her inclusive brand of Turkish-Armenian feminism.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Associate Professor Megan Black’s research digs into mining, power, and environmental politics in the US.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many respects, minerals are a matter of money and power. Fortunes are won through resource extraction, while mining companies throw their weight around and environmental advocates try to stop them. It is a familiar scenario anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes this story contains surprising elements. MIT Associate Professor Megan Black has found a rich seam of them in her career. Black is an environmental historian who studies the politics of resource extraction, breaking new ground in detailing U.S. government involvement in mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the “Point Four” program, in which U.S. Department of the Interior officials fanned out across the globe in the 1950s to work with other countries on resource-extraction issues. On the surface, this might seem a curious task for a department preferring to be known for domestic land management, conservation, and national parks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as Black shows in her award-winning 2018 book, “The Global Interior: Mineral Frontiers and American Power,” published by Harvard University Press, the program was actually consistent with the outlook of a department that, after its 1849 founding, had expanded mining at America’s frontiers. By the 1950s, that meant enhancing American interests around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Interior Department has had a very global reach,” Black says. “It’s a different story than one might expect about a department whose name declares a narrow portfolio. The department has been many places and helped project American power in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, consider the satellite revolution and mining, two things not usually viewed in tandem. Originally, satellites were regarded in national security terms or as a tool to anticipate weather. But the Landsat program, once jointly run by NASA and the U.S. Department of the Interior, let other nations and private corporations purchase images that were particularly useful to minerals exploration in the 1970s. Before long, as Black details in a 2019 article, Chevron found oil in Sudan and was pumping out millions of barrels there — another case of the Interior Department’s reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Minerals issues had always been a fulcrum of [Interior] departmental power, and remain a very powerful centerpiece of their actions,” Black says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Black is gathering more historical materials, this time for a slightly different kind of book project, about a Colorado mining dispute that has influenced how people think about the local effects of global industries. For her research and teaching, Black was awarded tenure at MIT earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospecting in the archives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black grew up in Kearney, Nebraska, and recognizes that her surroundings likely had some influence on her eventual studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The history of the Black Hills and gold extraction and settler colonialism looms very large in the part of the state where I’m from,” Black says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, Black majored in English and film studies, with a minor in history. She then enrolled in the American Studies program at George Washington University and became increasingly focused on environmental history, earning her MA in 2011 and her PhD in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Black began spending copious amounts of time at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, a major records respository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love that feeling of sifting through so much information and trying to piece together how things changed over time,” Black says. “Historians have a broad [capacity] for listening to sources, taking them seriously, and putting them in context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day as Black was prospecting around the archives, she came across the text of a 1952 speech by Assistant Secretary of the Interior Vernon Northrop, outlining a broad view of the department’s historical role. It cemented Black’s interest in the Interior Department’s expansive minerals interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He observed that whether it was the undeveloped [U.S.] West of the 1850s or the undeveloped world of the 1950s, the Interior Department had the requisite skillset to open up new frontiers,” Black says. “Northrop was making an argument about the department’s historical trajectory and for the continuity of its purpose across a broad swath of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing that idea — while not taking Northrop’s claims for granted — helped Black shape her dissertation, which became “The Global Interior.” The book garnered a remarkable set of awards: the George Perkins Marsh Prize from the American Society of Environmental History, the Stuart L. Bernath Prize from the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, the W. Turrentine-Jackson Prize from the Western History Association, and the British Association of American Studies Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, after earning her PhD, Black served as a lecturer at Harvard University for two years, then joined the faculty of the London School of Economics in 2017. She became an associate professor at MIT in 2020 and continued researching her next book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real meaning of “Think Globally, Act Locally”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That book project focuses on a 1970s political confrontation in the town of Crested Butte, Colorado, where the company AMAX wanted to mine molybdenum, an element used in steel products. The 1872 General Mining Law in the U.S. makes public land available for acquisition and resource extraction, and AMAX was planning an operation on several thousand acres of mountain property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the residents of Crested Butte, a town reorienting its economy to tourism, waged an energetic campaign to stop the development, aided by the group Friends of the Earth. Eventually, the local environmental advocates won, and AMAX (now Freeport McMoRan) abandoned the project. Black is analyzing these events, including the socioeconomic factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am interested in understanding the communities that have tried to say ‘No’ to mining,” Black explains. In Crested Butte, she notes, “Mostly white and educated elites were unimpressed by the thought that a multinational mining company would pursue an $8 billion investment there and tie up several thousand acres of public land.” And those well-off residents had the means and clout to win their local battle. However, Black adds, “Other communities were not in the same position to say ‘No’ to mining. Crested Butte had a rather singular ability to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Black points out, the company simply shifted or intensified operations in other places, from British Columbia to Australia and New Zealand, and elsewhere in Colorado. Where one town wards off a mining development, it may become another town’s issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the Crested Butte conflict may have helped popularize the slogan “Think Globally, Act Locally.” Which, in this case, can mean trying to lessen the global footprint of mining, so that local environmental action does not just transfer its location to somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are different ways we can approach building the world that will accomodate an energy transition in ways that lessen the burden on communities,” Black says. That’s also a point she raises in the classroom with students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Teaching at MIT has been a dream,” Black says. As her intellectual journey continues, things like the Crested Butte conflict seem increasingly relevant to the concerns her students have today, especially about climate change in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s not your older sibling’s climate catastrophe,” Black says. “There’s a necessity of making sure people understand the very existential reality of these changes. But it can be paralyzing to think about the extent of the problem, so examining how people have grappled with [environmental] issues opens up a set of possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Forging climate connections across the Institute</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Inaugural Fast Forward Faculty Fund grants aim to spur new work on climate change and deepen collaboration at MIT.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 01 Nov 2023 16:45:00 -0400</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Office of the Vice President for Research</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the ultimate cross-cutting issue: Not limited to any one discipline, it ranges across science, technology, policy, culture, human behavior, and well beyond. The response to it likewise requires an all-of-MIT effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to strengthen such an effort, a new grant program spearheaded by the &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/nucleus"&gt;Climate Nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, the faculty committee charged with the oversight and implementation of &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/climateaction/fastforward"&gt;Fast Forward: MIT’s Climate Action Plan for the Decade&lt;/a&gt;, aims to build up MIT’s climate leadership capacity while also supporting innovative scholarship on diverse climate-related topics and forging new connections across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called the Fast Forward Faculty Fund (F^4 for short), the program has named its first cohort of six faculty members after issuing its inaugural call for proposals in April 2023. The cohort will come together throughout the year for climate leadership development programming and networking. The program provides financial support for graduate students who will work with the faculty members on the projects&amp;nbsp;— the students will also participate in leadership-building activities&amp;nbsp;— as well as $50,000 in flexible, discretionary funding to be used to support related activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Climate change is a crisis that truly touches every single person on the planet,” says Noelle Selin, co-chair of the nucleus and interim director of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. “It’s therefore essential that we build capacity for every member of the MIT community to make sense of the problem and help address it. Through the Fast Forward Faculty Fund, our aim is to have a cohort of climate ambassadors who can embed climate everywhere at the Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F^4 supports both faculty who would like to begin doing climate-related work, as well as faculty members who are interested in deepening their work on climate. The program has the core goal of developing cohorts of F^4 faculty and graduate students who, in addition to conducting their own research, will become climate leaders at MIT, proactively looking for ways to forge new climate connections across schools, departments, and disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the projects, “Climate Crisis and Real Estate: Science-based Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies,” led by Professor Siqi Zheng of the MIT Center for Real Estate in collaboration with colleagues from the MIT Sloan School of Management, focuses on the roughly 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions that come from the buildings and real estate sector. Zheng notes that this sector has been slow to respond to climate change, but says that is starting to change, thanks in part to the rising awareness of climate risks and new local regulations aimed at reducing emissions from buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a data-driven approach, the project seeks to understand the efficient and equitable market incentives, technology solutions, and public policies that are most effective at transforming the real estate industry. Johnattan Ontiveros, a graduate student in the Technology and Policy Program, is working with Zheng on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were thrilled at the incredible response we received from the MIT faculty to our call for proposals, which speaks volumes about the depth and breadth of interest in climate at MIT,” says Anne White, nucleus co-chair and vice provost and associate vice president for research. “This program makes good on key commitments of the Fast Forward plan, supporting cutting-edge new work by faculty and graduate students while helping to deepen the bench of climate leaders at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 2023-24 academic year, the F^4 faculty and graduate student cohorts will come together to discuss their projects, explore opportunities for collaboration, participate in climate leadership development, and think proactively about how to deepen interdisciplinary connections among MIT community members interested in climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six inaugural F^4 awardees are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Tristan Brown, History Section: Humanistic Approaches to the Climate Crisis &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this project, Brown aims to create a new community of practice around narrative-centric approaches to environmental and climate issues. Part of a broader humanities initiative at MIT, it brings together a global working group of interdisciplinary scholars, including Serguei Saavedra (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering) and Or Porath (Tel Aviv University; Religion), collectively focused on examining the historical and present links between sacred places and biodiversity for the purposes of helping governments and nongovernmental organizations formulate better sustainability goals. Boyd Ruamcharoen, a PhD student in the History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society (HASTS) program, will work with Brown on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Kerri Cahoy, departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (AeroAstro): Onboard Autonomous AI-driven Satellite Sensor Fusion for Coastal Region Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this project is the need for much better data collection from satellites, where technology can be “20 years behind,” says Cahoy. As part of this project, Cahoy will pursue research in the area of autonomous artificial intelligence-enabled rapid sensor fusion (which combines data from different sensors, such as radar and cameras) onboard satellites to improve understanding of the impacts of climate change, specifically sea-level rise and hurricanes and flooding in coastal regions. Graduate students Madeline Anderson, a PhD student in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS), and Mary Dahl, a PhD student in AeroAstro, will work with Cahoy on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Priya Donti, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science: Robust Reinforcement Learning for High-Renewables Power Grids&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With renewables like wind and solar making up a growing share of electricity generation on power grids, Donti's project focuses on improving control methods for these distributed sources of electricity. The research will aim to create a realistic representation of the characteristics of power grid operations, and eventually inform scalable operational improvements in power systems. It will “give power systems operators faith that, OK, this conceptually is good, but it also actually works on this grid,” says Donti. PhD candidate Ana Rivera from EECS is the F^4 graduate student on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Jason Jackson, Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP): Political Economy of the Climate Crisis: Institutions, Power and Global Governance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project takes a political economy approach to the climate crisis, offering a distinct lens to examine, first, the political governance challenge of mobilizing climate action and designing new institutional mechanisms to address the global and intergenerational distributional aspects of climate change; second, the economic challenge of devising new institutional approaches to equitably finance climate action; and third, the cultural challenge&amp;nbsp;— and opportunity&amp;nbsp;— of empowering an adaptive socio-cultural ecology through traditional knowledge and local-level social networks to achieve environmental resilience. Graduate students Chen Chu and Mrinalini Penumaka, both PhD students in DUSP, are working with Jackson on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Haruko Wainwright, departments of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) and Civil and Environmental Engineering: Low-cost Environmental Monitoring Network Technologies in Rural Communities for Addressing Climate Justice&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will establish a community-based climate and environmental monitoring network in addition to a data visualization and analysis infrastructure in rural marginalized communities to better understand and address climate justice issues. The project team plans to work with rural communities in Alaska to install low-cost air and water quality, weather, and soil sensors. Graduate students Kay Whiteaker, an MS candidate in NSE, and Amandeep Singh, and MS candidate in System Design and Management at Sloan, are working with Wainwright on the project, as is David McGee, professor in earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Siqi Zheng, MIT Center for Real Estate and DUSP: Climate Crisis and Real Estate: Science-based Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the text above for the details on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford, inaugurates a new campus series on academic freedom and expression.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 16:55:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/books-under-attack-then-and-now-1026</guid>
        <dc:creator>Brigham Fay | MIT Libraries</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Richard Ovenden was dressed appropriately for the start of Banned Books Week. He proudly displayed the American Library Association’s “Free people read freely” T-shirt as he approached the podium at Hayden Library on Oct. 2. Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford, spoke about the willful destruction of recorded knowledge for an event titled “Book Wars,” the inaugural event in a new series called Conversations on Academic Freedom and Expression (CAFE), a collaboration between the MIT Libraries and History at MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The idea for CAFE is to introduce the MIT community to the broader landscape of what’s going on in the world of academic freedom and free expression, beyond some of our local exchanges,” says Malick Ghachem, history professor and department head and a member of MIT’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The libraries were a natural partner for the CAFE series,” says Chris Bourg, director of MIT Libraries. “The value of free and open access to information underpins everything we do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovenden, who writes extensively on libraries, archives, and information management, is the author of “Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge,” which was shortlisted for the Wolfson History Prize in 2021. In his MIT talk he provided a historical overview of attacks on libraries&amp;nbsp;— from the library of Ashurbanipal in the Assyrian capital of Nineveh (now northern Iraq), destroyed by fire in 612 BC, to book burning under the Nazi regime to current efforts across the United States to remove or restrict access to books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of this history of loss, Ovenden finds hope in “the human impulse to preserve, to pass on, to bear witness, to allow for diverse ideas to thrive.” He detailed the extraordinary actions people have taken to save knowledge, citing the “Paper Brigade,” a forced labor unit of poets and intellectuals in Nazi-occupied Vilnius who smuggled and hid rare books and manuscripts, and the tragic death of Aida Buturovic, a 32-year-old librarian who was killed as she tried to rescue books during the 1992 assault on the National and University Library in Sarajevo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ovenden concluded by making the case that libraries and archives are the infrastructure for democracy — institutions dedicated not only to education, but to safeguarding the rights of citizens, providing reference points for facts and truth, preserving identity, and enabling a diversity of views. Despite millennia of attacks, libraries continue to fight back, most recently with public libraries expanding digital access to combat book bans nationwide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Ovenden’s talk, Ghachem led a discussion and audience Q&amp;amp;A that touched on the connections between book bans and so-called “cancel culture,” how censorship itself is used as a means of expressing political views, and growing distrust of expertise.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAFE series is one of several opportunities to engage the Institute community that emerged from the &lt;a href="https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/sites/default/files/20220901_Final_Report_of_the_Ad_Hoc_Working_Group_on_Free_Expression.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Report of the MIT Ad Hoc Working Group on Free Expression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ghachem also started a new first-year advising seminar, “Free Expression, Pluralism, and the University,” and the Institute Community and Equity Office launched &lt;a href="https://iceo.mit.edu/dialogues-across-difference/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dialogues Across Difference: Building Community at MIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A second CAFE event is being planned for the spring term.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At this moment in our history, we should try to encourage discussion, and not debate,” said Ovenden. “We must try to move away from this idea that it’s a contest, that it’s a battle, and encourage and foster the idea of listening and discussion. And that's all part of the deliberation that I think is necessary for a healthy society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Book Wars: CAFE with Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian, Oxford” was co-sponsored by MIT Libraries, MIT History, and MIT Open Learning.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is widely recognized that the period in the early 1970s in which Salvador Allende was president of Chile was a moment of political innovation, when people thought they could bring about socialist transformation peacefully and within existing democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People thought that this would be a political third way,” says &lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/eden-medina/"&gt;Eden Medina&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in MIT’s &lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/"&gt;Program in Science, Technology, and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a military coup brought a premature end to Chilean democracy and resulted in Allende’s death. But it’s a period of political and cultural history to which Medina has dedicated extensive research. As the culmination of that work, Medina is co-curating a museum exhibition, “How to Design a Revolution: The Chilean Road to Design” (in Spanish, “Cómo diseñar una revolución: La vía chilena al diseño”). The exhibition coincides with the 50th anniversary of the military coup. It’s the most extensive presentation of the history of graphic and industrial design during the Allende period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has really been a collective effort to bring this history to the Chilean public and also to a larger international public,” says Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition opened at the &lt;a href="https://www.cclm.cl/"&gt;Centro Cultural La Moneda&lt;/a&gt;, the cultural center of the Chilean presidential palace, beginning last month. Medina is co-curating the exhibition with Professor &lt;a href="https://diseno.uc.cl/persona/palmarola-hugo/"&gt;Hugo Palmarola&lt;/a&gt; and Professor &lt;a href="https://arc-hum.princeton.edu/people/pedro-ignacio-alonso"&gt;Pedro Ignacio Alonso&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.uc.cl/"&gt;Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile&lt;/a&gt;. The exhibit will be accompanied by a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/how-design-revolution"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, which will be available in English and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research we’ve been doing shows that this innovative political project opened the door to other kinds of innovation, including artistic innovation, and innovation in the areas of design, science, and technology,” says Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina says the exhibition is bringing a new interpretation of the Popular Unity period and the practice of Chile’s political transformation. The exhibition features 350 pieces, including a full-scale reconstruction of the Cybersyn Operations Room, a pioneering project in cybernetics. The operations room was designed by the Industrial Design Area of the Chilean State Technology Institute between 1972 and 1973, and some of its original designers — Gui Bonsiepe, Fernando Shultz, Rodrigo Walker, and Pepa Foncea — collaborated in the reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By showing these designed projects, whether it’s the creation of a spoon to measure powdered milk or a poster to get people to volunteer their labor, we’re seeing what people did and how they were trying to figure out ways of bringing about socialist transformation,” says Medina. “The exhibition explores how those in the past looked to graphic and industrial design to create collective action, democratize knowledge and music, reduce technological dependency, improve child nutrition, and manage the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regina Rodríguez Covarrubias, director of Centro Cultural La Moneda, says it’s the center’s most important exhibition of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within the framework of the 50 years since the civil-military coup, this exhibition speaks to us from a little-explored place, beyond the trauma of the civil-military coup and the dictatorship: It allows us to know and appreciate an avant-garde Chile that used its creative resources to democratize culture, educate, and build bonds of coexistence in favor of equity and innovation,” says Rodríguez Covarrubias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of collaboration between MIT and the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Medina is excited to see what visitors experience when they step inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When they go into the space of the Cybersyn Operations Room, they’ll see that the space isn't a fantasy, it was something that people built. It was futuristic, but it was also built under conditions of constraint. And you see how people were really creative when working under these conditions. They built something that was cutting edge using simple technologies. Even a low-tech space can be futuristic, and that is generative as we think about sustainable design today and the potential need to make better use of older technologies,” says Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project involved MIT graduate students from the Department of Architecture and undergraduate students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Medina says the project wouldn’t have been possible without the support of the students, which she says was an opportunity for them to collaborate with the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;SHASS&lt;/a&gt;) on a public-facing project in the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds the exhibition is an example of SHASS’s international reach, and how the humanities can collaborate with engineering and architecture to build historical objects and environments from a major historical moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT provides a way of doing the humanities that I think is very unique. It allows students to take their technical training and their propensity to build and marry it with things like archival research and historical interpretation, and bring those skills together, in this case, for public communication,” says Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT students working on the project say it’s been a transformative experience, one that uniquely combined their skills across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alissa Serfozo, a designer and master of architecture candidate at MIT, joined the project in autumn 2022 as a researcher and then editorial assistant for the exhibition edited volume. She conducted research on the posters designed during the time period that were ultimately recreated as artifacts in the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach was to think critically about designed objects as political instruments. We considered the posters’ entire life cycle, from production to dissemination, observing the proximity of design and politics during this historical period,” she says. “Many of these posters live in private archives and are not often visible to the public. I’m thrilled to see the collection materialize in the final product of the exhibit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serfozo says learning about the kinds of graphic design and printing used in that period inspired her to further her own expertise in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Throughout learning about the history of printing in 19th- and 20th-century&amp;nbsp;Chile, I simultaneously became interested in that practice. I took cyanotype classes at the Student Art Association and did a self-study in silkscreen printing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azania Umoja, also a master’s student studying architecture, worked as editorial assistant for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, I'm very interested in work that redefines what architecture is and what it means to be an architect. Seeing the intersection between design and this important political movement in Chile's history was really fascinating to me,” Umoja says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rihn Hong '23 and Josh Noguera '23, who both graduated in the spring with bachelor’s degrees in mechanical engineering, worked on getting the logic and electronic recreation of the operations room functional. They spent time in Chile this summer putting the final touches on the exhibit. Noguera says one of his favorite parts of the project has been the intersection between historical research and technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with the museum curators in Chile has been incredibly fulfilling in terms of getting experience, working with other people, and other teams,” says Noguera. “And now with recreating the system, a lot of interesting challenges that both Rihn and I have is the discussion of what should be omitted, or striking a balance between user experience in the exhibit and historical accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariana González Medrano MArch '23 completed her MIT master’s in architecture this spring, and was responsible for creating some of the early plans for the design of the operations room. It’s hexagonal and measures 72&amp;nbsp;square meters with seven fiberglass armchairs equipped with buttons for remotely controlling screens on the room’s walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges, she says, was the discrepancy she often found in the historical documents about what was planned and what was realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And those discrepancies really lie in those small details of what angle do the walls curve in, exactly how high is the ceiling going to be, where does this thing exactly connect to the wall,” she says. “All these things end up having a large impact on the room. And every document carries its own story and vision of what the room is meant to do or convey in terms of how every single object and every detail relates to each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming full circle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Medina, the exhibit is the completion of years of work and research. Part of the work she’s doing to build and display this exhibit was part of her dissertation at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you had told my grad student-self that one day my dissertation research would be on display as part of a major historical anniversary in Chile, in the cultural center of the presidential palace, I just wouldn't have believed you,” she says. “It is such an opportunity to communicate history of technology research to a broad public and help them see the relationship of politics and technological design and to do it in a different kind of way. Not only to do it through a written text, which is how historians often work, but to actually build the space and invite members of the public to step inside. That's really special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Hugo Palmarola considers this to be one of the most important cases of design in Latin America, since it is historically located at a fundamental turning point for development models in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pieces selected for this exhibition were designed at the time to create new ways of life and a new political, social, and economic world. In this regard, we as curators think that these pieces configure a truly unprecedented project, which may have important implications in global debates and global studies of design, visual and material culture, technology, and curatorship,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Pedro Ignacio Alonso says the making of the exhibition was not just a way to show results of a research project, but also a different way to keep learning about the history of the period, through its designed objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is, as it were, a different research format in the careful displaying of both original pieces from archives, and our reconstructions of objects that have disappeared long time ago, that now reemerge within our curatorial work,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the exhibit closes in January, Medina says it is designed to travel, though there are no specific plans yet for where it might go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medina says her hope is the exhibit will bring to light the way people tackled some of the core challenges of society during this unique historical moment, so that it might inspire new ways of approaching similar challenges today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you improve education, nutrition? How do you raise the standard of living for the poorest members of society? How do you get people to participate politically? All of these questions are still relevant today. While the solutions people developed 50 years ago are not the same solutions that we need today, we can still learn from them and find inspiration in how design and technology in Chile foregrounded social, political, and human values,” says Medina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for the project was provided by the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;nbsp;the Program in Science, Technology, and Society; the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; the Centro Cultural La Moneda; the &lt;a href="https://www.gob.cl/en/ministries/ministry-of-science-technology-knowledge-and-innovation/"&gt;Chilean Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge, and Innovation&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href="https://www.gob.cl/en/ministries/ministry-of-culture-arts-and-heritage/"&gt;Chilean Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Heritage&lt;/a&gt;; and the &lt;a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/cl/es/index.html"&gt;Goethe Institut Chile&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/faculty-funds" target="_blank"&gt;MISTI Global Seed Funds&lt;/a&gt; supported the collaborative work for the exhibition in its early stages, and the &lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-chile" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-Chile Program&lt;/a&gt; provided support for student travel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What if we’ve been thinking about artificial intelligence the wrong way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, AI is often discussed as something that could replicate human intelligence and replace human work. But there is an alternate future: one in which AI provides “machine usefulness” for human workers, augmenting but not usurping jobs, while helping to create productivity gains and spread prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be a fairly rosy scenario. However, as MIT economist Daron Acemoglu emphasized in a public campus lecture on Tuesday night, society has started to move in a different direction — one in which AI replaces jobs and rachets up societal surveillance, and in the process reinforces economic inequality while concentrating political power further in the hands of the ultra-wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are transformative and very consequential choices ahead of us,” warned Acemoglu, Institute Professor at MIT, who has spent years studying the impact of automation on jobs and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major innovations, Acemoglu suggested, are almost always bound up with matters of societal power and control, especially those involving automation. Technology generally helps society increase productivity; the question is how narrowly or widely those economic benefits are shared. When it comes to AI, he observed, these questions matter acutely “because there are so many different directions in which these technologies can be developed. It is quite possible they could bring broad-based benefits — or they might actually enrich and empower a very narrow elite.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when innovations augment rather than replace workers’ tasks, he noted, it creates conditions in which prosperity can spread to the work force itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The objective is not to make machines intelligent in and of themselves, but more and more useful to humans,” said Acemoglu, speaking to a near-capacity audience of almost 300 people in Wong Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Productivity Bandwagon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Starr Forum is a public event series held by MIT’s Center for International Studies (CIS), and focused on leading issues of global interest. Tuesday’s event was hosted by Evan Lieberman, director of CIS and the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu’s talk drew on themes detailed in his book “Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,” which was co-written with Simon Johnson and published in May by PublicAffairs. Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday’s talk, as in his book, Acemoglu discussed some famous historial examples to make the point that the widespread benefits of new technology cannot be assumed, but are conditional on how technology is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took at least 100 years after the 18th-century onset of the Industrial Revolution, Acemoglu noted, for the productivity gains of industrialization to be widely shared. At first, real earnings did not rise, working hours increased by 20 percent, and labor conditions worsened as factory textile workers lost much of the autonomy they had held as independent weavers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Acemoglu observed, Eli Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin made the conditions of slavery in the U.S. even worse. That overall dynamic, in which innovation can potentially enrich a few at the expense of the many, Acemoglu said, has not vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying that this time is different,” Acemoglu said. “This time is very similar to what went on in the past. There has always been this tension about who controls technology and whether the gains from technology are going to be widely shared.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, he noted, there are many, many ways society has ultimately benefitted from technologies. But it’s not something we can take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes indeed, we are immeasurably more prosperous, healthier, and more comfortable today than people were 300 years ago,” Acemoglu said. “But again, there was nothing automatic about it, and the path to that improvement was circuitous.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately what society must aim for, Acemoglu said, is what he and Johnson term “The Productivity Bandwagon” in their book. That is the condition in which technological innovation is adapted to help workers, not replace them, spreading economic growth more widely. In this way, productivity growth is accompanied by shared prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Productivity Bandwagon is not a force of nature that applies under all circumstances automatically, and with great force, but it is something that’s conditional on the nature of technology and how production is organized and the gains are shared,” Acemoglu said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, he added, this “double process” of innovation involves one more thing: a significant amount of worker power, something which has eroded in recent decades in many places, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That erosion of worker power, he acknowledged, has made it less likely that multifaceted technologies will be used in ways that help the labor force. Still, Acemoglu noted, there is a healthy tradition within the ranks of technologists, including innovators such as Norbert Wiener and Douglas Engelbart, to “make machines more useable, or more useful to humans, and AI could pursue that path.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Acemoglu noted, “There is every danger that overemphasizing automation is not going to get you many productivity gains either,” since some technologies may be merely cheaper than human workers, not more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Icarus and us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event included a commentary from Fotini Christia, the Ford International Professor of the Social Sciences and director of the MIT Sociotechnical Systems Research Center. Christia offered that “Power and Progress” was “a tremendous book about the forces of technology and how to channel them for the greater good.” She also noted “how prevalent these themes have been even going back to ancient times,” referring to Greek myths involving Daedalus, Icarus, and Prometheus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Christia raised a series of pressing questions about the themes of Acemoglu’s talk, including whether the advent of AI represented a more concerning set of problems than previous episodes of technological advancement, many of which ultimately helped many people; which people in society have the most ability and responsibility to help produce changes; and whether AI might have a different impact on developing countries in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an extensive audience question-and-answer session, Acemoglu fielded over a dozen questions, many of them about the distribution of earnings, global inequality, and how workers might organize themselves to have a say in the implementation of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, Acemoglu suggested it is still to be determined how greater worker power can be obtained, and noted that workers themselves should help suggest productive uses for AI. At multiple points, he noted that workers cannot just protest circumstances, but must also pursue policy changes as well — if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is some degree of optimism in saying we can actually redirect technology and that it’s a social choice,” Acemoglu acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu also suggested that countries in the global South were also vulnerable to the potential effects of AI, in a few ways. For one thing, he noted, as the work of MIT economist Martin Beraja shows, China has been exporting AI surveillance technologies to governments in many developing countries. For another, he noted, countries that have made overall economic progress by employing more of their citizens in low-wage industries might find labor force participation being undercut by AI developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Acemoglu warned, if private companies or central governments anywhere in the world amass more and more information about people, it is likely to have negative consequences for most of the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As long as that information can be used without any constraints, it’s going to be antidemocratic and it’s going to be inequality-inducing,” he said. “There is every danger that AI, if it goes down the automation path, could be a highly unequalizing technology around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Professor Emerita Evelyn Fox Keller, a distinguished and groundbreaking philosopher and historian of science, died on Sept. 22, at age 87.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller gained acclaim for her powerful critique of the scientific establishment’s conception of objectivity, which she found lacking in its own terms and heavily laden with gendered assumptions. Her work drove many scholars toward a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the subjective factors and socially driven modes of thought that can shape scientific theories and hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trained physicist who conducted academic research in biology and then focused on the scientific enterprise and the self-understanding of scientists, Keller joined MIT in 1992, serving in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having faced outright hostility and discouragement as a female graduate student in the sciences in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Keller by the 1980s had become a prominent academic thinker and public intellectual, ready and willing to bring her ideas to a larger general audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no magic lens that will enable us to look at, to see nature unclouded … uncolored by any values, hopes, fears, anxieties, desires, goals that we bring to it,” Keller told journalist Bill Moyers in 1990 for his “World of Ideas” show on PBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By that time, Keller had become well-known for two high-profile books. In “A Feeling for the Organism: The Life and Work of Barbara McClintock” published in 1983, Keller examined the work of the biologist whose close studies of corn showed that genetic elements could move around on a chromosome over time, affecting gene expression. Initially ignored, McClintock won the Nobel Prize — within a year of the book’s publication — and her distinctive, well-developed sense of her own research methods meshed with, and fed into, Keller’s ideas about the complexity of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Reflections on Gender and Science,” published in 1985, Keller looked broadly at how the 17th-century institutionalization of science both demarcated it strictly as an activity for men and, relatedly, generated a notion of purely objective inquiry that stood in contrast to the purportedly more emotional and less linear thinking of women. Those foundational works helped other scholars question the idea of unmediated scientific discovery and better recognize the immense gender imbalances in the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overcoming hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller, born Evelyn Fox, grew up in New York City, a child of Russian Jewish immigrant parents, and first attended Queens College as an undergraduate, before transferring to Brandeis University, where she received her BA in physics in 1957. She received an MA in from Radcliffe College in 1959 and earned her PhD in physics from Harvard University in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social environment Keller encountered while working toward her PhD, however, showed her firsthand how much science could be a closed shop to women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was leered at by some,” Keller later wrote, recounting “open and unbelievably rude laughter with which I was often received.” As the journalist Beth Horning wrote in a 1993 profile of Keller published in &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;, Keller’s “seriousness and ambition were publicly derided by both her peers and her elders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as Keller was taken aback, she kept moving forward, earning her doctorate while turning her academic focus toward molecular biology. After briefly returning to physics early in her research career, Keller took a faculty position in mathematical biology at Northeastern University. Among other appointments, Keller served on the faculty at the State University of New York at Purchase, where she began expanding her teaching toward subjects such as women’s studies, and writing about the institutional difficulties she had faced in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 1970s, Keller had met McClintock and started writing about McClintock’s work — a kind of case study in the complicated issues Keller wanted to explore. The book’s title was a McClintock phrase, about having “a feeling for the organism” one was studying; McClintock emphasized the importance of being closely attuned to the corn she was studying, which ultimately helped her detect some of the unexpected genomic behavior she identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Keller would often emphasize later on, this approach did not mean that McClintock was pursuing science in a distinctively feminine way, either. Instead, as Horning notes, Keller’s aim, stated in “Reflections on Gender and Science,” was the “reclamation, from within science, of science as a human instead of a masculine project.” McClintock’s methods may have been considered unusual and her findings unexpected, but that reflected a narrowness on the part of the scientific establishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the Institute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller first joined MIT in a visiting capacity, then in 1988 moved to the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley. She joined MIT as a tenured faculty member four years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Keller joined her older brother, Maurice Fox, in the Institute faculty ranks. Fox was an accomplished biologist who taught at MIT from 1962 through 1996, served as head of the Department of Biology from 1985 through 1989, and was an expert in mutation and recombination, among other subjects; he died in 2020. Keller’s sister is the prominent scholar and social activist Frances Fox Piven, whose wide-ranging work has examined social welfare, working class movements, and democratic practices in the U.S., and influenced the expansion of voting access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1992 Keller received a MacArthur Foundation “genius” award for her scholarship. The foundation called her “a scholar whose interdisciplinary work raises important questions about the interrelationships among language, gender, and science,” while also noting that she had “stimulated thought about alternative styles of scientific research” through her book on McClintock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, Keller wrote 11 books on science and co-edited three other volumes; her individually authored books include “The Century of the Gene” (2000, Harvard University Press), “Making Sense of Life” (2002, Harvard University Press), and &amp;nbsp;“The Mirage of a Space between Nature and Nurture” (2010, Duke University Press).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That third book examined the history and implications of nature-nurture debates. Keller found the purported distinction between nature and nurture to be a relatively recent one historically, promoted heavily in the late 19th century by the statistician (and eugenicist) Francis Galton, but not one that had much currency before then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re stuck with our DNA, but lots of things affect the way DNA is deployed,” Keller told &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt; in 2010, in an interview about the book. “It’s not enough to know what your DNA sequence is to understand about disease, behavior, and physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, in early 2023, Keller also published an autobiography, “Making Sense of My Life in Science: A Memoir,” issued by Modern Memoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An intrepid scholar, Keller’s work helped make clear that, although nature exists apart from humans, our understanding of it is always mediated by our own ideas and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Keller told Moyers in 1990, “it is a fantasy that any human product could be free of human values. And science is a human product. It’s a wonderful, glorious human product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other career honors, Keller was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and to the American Philosophical Society; received a Guggenheim Fellowship; was granted the 2018 Dan David Prize; and also received honorary degrees from Dartmouth University, Lulea University of Technology, Mount Holyoke College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Simmons College, the University of Amsterdam, and Wesleyan University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keller is survived by her son, Jeffrey Keller; her daughter, Sarah Keller; her sister, Frances Fox Piven; her grand-daughters, Chloe Marschall and Cale Marschall; her nephews, Jonathan Fox, Gregory Fox, and Michael Fox, and her niece, Sarah Piven.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Ancient Amazonians intentionally created fertile “dark earth”</title>

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Amazon river basin is known for its immense and lush tropical forests, so one might assume that the Amazon’s land is equally rich. In fact, the soils underlying the forested vegetation, particularly in the hilly uplands, are surprisingly infertile. Much of the Amazon’s soil is acidic and low in nutrients, making it notoriously difficult to farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the years, archaeologists have dug up mysteriously black and fertile patches of ancient soils in hundreds of sites across the Amazon. This “dark earth” has been found in and around human settlements dating back hundreds to thousands of years. And it has been a matter of some debate as to whether the super-rich soil was purposefully created or a coincidental byproduct of these ancient cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a study led by researchers at MIT, the University of Florida, and in Brazil aims to settle the debate over dark earth’s origins. The team has pieced together results from soil analyses, ethnographic observations, and interviews with modern Indigenous communities, to show that dark earth was intentionally produced by ancient Amazonians as a way to improve the soil and sustain large and complex societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to have large settlements, you need a nutritional base. But the soil in the Amazon is extensively leached of nutrients, and naturally poor for growing most crops,” says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. “We argue here that people played a role in creating dark earth, and intentionally modified the ancient environment to make it a better place for human populations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, dark earth contains huge amounts of stored carbon. As generations worked the soil, for instance by enriching it with scraps of food, charcoal, and waste, the earth accumulated the carbon-rich detritus and kept it locked up for hundreds to thousands of years. By purposely producing dark earth, then, early Amazonians may have also unintentionally created a powerful, carbon-sequestering soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ancient Amazonians put a lot of carbon in the soil, and a lot of that is still there today,” says co-author Samuel Goldberg, who performed the data analysis as a graduate student at MIT and is now an assistant professor at the University of Miami. “That’s exactly what we want for climate change mitigation efforts. Maybe we could adapt some of their indigenous strategies on a larger scale, to lock up carbon in soil, in ways that we now know would stay there for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s study &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adh8499" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. Other authors include former MIT postdoc and lead author Morgan Schmidt, anthropologist Michael Heckenberger of the University of Florida, and collaborators from multiple institutions across Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern intent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their current study, the team synthesized observations and data that Schmidt, Heckenberger, and others had previously gathered, while working with Indigenous communities in the Amazon since the early&amp;nbsp;2000s,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;with new data collected in 2018-19. The scientists focused their fieldwork in the Kuikuro&amp;nbsp;Indigenous Territory in the Upper Xingu River basin in the southeastern Amazon. This region is home to modern Kuikuro villages as well as archaeological sites&amp;nbsp;where the ancestors of the Kuikuro are thought to have lived. Over multiple visits to the region, Schmidt, then a graduate student at the University of Florida, was struck by the darker soil around some archaeological sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When I saw this dark earth and how fertile it was, and started digging into what was known about it, I found it was a mysterious thing — no one really knew where it came from,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schmidt and his colleagues began making observations of the modern Kuikuro’s practices of managing the soil. These practices include generating “middens” — piles of waste and food scraps, similar to compost heaps, that are maintained in certain locations around the center of a village. After some time, these waste piles decompose and mix with the soil to form a dark and fertile earth, that residents then use to plant crops. The researchers also observed that Kuikuro farmers spread organic waste and ash on farther fields, which also generates dark earth, where they can then grow more crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We saw activities they did to modify the soil and increase the elements, like spreading ash on the ground, or spreading charcoal around the base of the tree, which were obviously intentional actions,” Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these observations, they also conducted interviews with villagers to document the Kuikuro’s beliefs and practices relating to dark earth. In some of these interviews, villagers referred to dark earth as “eegepe,” and described their daily practices in creating and cultivating the rich soil to improve its agricultural potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these observations and interviews with the Kuikuro, it was clear that Indigenous communities today intentionally produce dark earth, through their practices to improve the soil. But could the dark earth found in nearby archaeological sites have been made through similar intentional practices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bridge in soil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In search of a connection, Schmidt joined Perron’s group as a postdoc at MIT. Together, he, Perron, and Goldberg carried out a meticulous analysis of soils in both archaeological and modern sites in the Upper Xingu region. They discovered similarities in dark earth’s spatial structure: Deposits of dark earth were found in a radial pattern, concentrating mostly in the center of both modern and ancient settlements, and stretching, like spokes of a wheel, out to the edges. Modern and ancient dark earth was also similar in composition, and was enriched in the same elements, such as carbon, phosphorus, and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are all the elements that are in humans, animals, and plants, and they’re the ones that reduce the aluminum toxicity in soil, which is a notorious problem in the Amazon,” Schmidt says. “All these elements make the soil better for plant growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key bridge between the modern and ancient times is the soil,” Goldberg adds. “Because we see this correspondence between the two time periods, we can infer that these practices that we can observe and ask people about today, were also happening in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the team was able to show for the first time that ancient Amazonians intentionally worked the soil, likely through practices similar to today’s, in order to grow enough crops to sustain large communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going a step further, the team calculated the amount of carbon in ancient dark earth. They combined their measurements of soil samples, with maps of where dark earth has been found through several ancient settlements. Their estimates revealed that each ancient village contains several thousand tons of carbon that has been sequestered in the soil for hundreds of years as a result of Indigenous, human activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the team concludes in their paper, “modern sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation efforts, inspired by the persistent fertility of ancient dark earth, can draw on traditional methods practiced to this day by Indigenous Amazonians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research at MIT was supported, in part, by MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab and the Department of the Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator. Field research was supported by grants to the University of Florida from the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation and the William Talbott Hillman Foundation, and was sponsored in Brazil by the Museu Goeldi and Museu Nacional.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Michael Brindley | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steven Gonzalez is a PhD candidate in the MIT Doctoral Program in&amp;nbsp;History, Anthropology, Science, Technology, and Society (&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/hasts/"&gt;HASTS&lt;/a&gt;), where he researches the environmental impacts of cloud computing and data centers in the United States, Iceland, and Puerto Rico. He is also an author. Writing under the name E.G. Condé, he recently published his first book, “&lt;a href="https://egconde.com/books/sordidez/"&gt;Sordidez&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s described as an “Indigenous futurist science fiction novella set in Puerto Rico and the Yucatán.” Set in the near future, it follows the survivors of civil war and climate disaster led by protagonist Vero Diaz, as they reclaim their Indigenous heritage and heal their lands. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this Q&amp;amp;A, Gonzalez describes the book's themes, its inspirations, and its connection to research, people, and classes at MIT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Where did the inspiration for this story come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I actually began my time at MIT in September of 2017 when Hurricane María struck. It was a really difficult time for me at the Institute, starting a PhD program. And it's MIT, so there's a lot of pressure. I was still kind of navigating the new institutional space and trying to understand my place in it. But I had a lot of people at the Institute who were extremely supportive during that time. I had family members in Puerto Rico who were stranded as a result of the hurricane, who I didn't hear from for a very long time&amp;nbsp;— who I feared dead. It was a very, very chaotic, confusing, and emotionally turbulent time for me, and also incredibly difficult to be trying to be present in a PhD program for the first semester. Karen Gardner, our administrator, was really incredibly supportive in that. Also the folks at the &lt;a href="http://apr.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Association of Puerto Ricans&lt;/a&gt;, who hosted fundraisers and linked students with counseling resources. But that trauma of the hurricane and the images that I saw of the aftermath of the hurricane, specifically in the town where my grandmother's house was where I spent time living as a child during the summers, and to me, it was the greenest place that I have ever known. It looked like somebody had torched the entire landscape. It was traumatizing to see that image. But that kind of seeded the idea of, is there a way to burn without fire? There's climate change, but there's also climate terror. And so that was sort of one of the premises of the book explores, geoengineering, but also the flip side of geoengineering and terraforming is, of course, climate terror. And in a way, we could frame what's been happening with the fossil fuel industry as a form of climate terror, as well. So for me, this all began right when I started at MIT, these dual tracks of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you see as the core themes of your novella?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One major theme is rebuilding. As I said, this story was very influenced by the trauma of Hurricane María and the incredibly inspiring accounts from family members, from people in Puerto Rico that I know, of regular people stepping up when the government — both federal and local — essentially abandoned them. There were so many failures of governance. But people stepped up and did what they could to help each other, to help neighbors. Neighbors cleared trees from roads. They banded together to do this. They pooled resources, to run generators so that everyone in the same street could have food that day. They would share medical supplies like insulin and things that were scarce. This was incredibly inspiring for me. And a huge theme of the book is rebuilding in the aftermath of a fictive hurricane, which I call Teddy, named after President Theodore Roosevelt, where Puerto Rico's journey began as a U.S. commonwealth or a colony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healing is also a huge theme. Healing in the sense of this story was also somewhat critical of Puerto Rican culture. And it's refracted through my own experience as a queer person navigating the space of Puerto Rico as a very kind of religious and traditional place and a very complex place at that. The main character, Vero, is a trans man. This is a person who's transitioned and has felt a lot of alienation and as a result of his gender transition, a lot of people don't accept him and don't accept his identity or who he is even though he's incredibly helpful in this rebuilding effort to the point where he's, in some ways, a leader, if not the leader. And it becomes, in a way, about healing from the trauma of rejection too. And of course, Vero, but other characters who have gone through various traumas that I think are very much shared across Latin America, the Latin American experiences of assimilation, for instance. Latin America is a very complex place. We have Spanish as our language, that is our kind of lingua franca. But there are many Indigenous languages that people speak that have been not valued or people who speak them or use them are actively punished. And there's this deep trauma of losing language. And in the case of Puerto Rico, the Indigenous language of the Taínos has been destroyed by colonialism. The story is about rebuilding that language and healing and “becoming.” In some ways, it's about re-indigenization. And then the last part, as I said, healing, reconstruction, but also transformation and metamorphosis. And becoming Taíno. Again, what does that mean? What does it mean to be an Indigenous Caribbean in the future? And so that's one of the central themes of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How does the novella intersect with the work you’re doing as a PhD candidate in HASTS?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; My research on cloud computing is very much about climate change. It's pitched within the context of climate change and understanding how our digital ecosystem contributes to not only global warming, but things like desertification. As a social scientist, that's what I study. My studies of infrastructure are also directly referenced in the book in a lot of ways. For instance, the now collapsed Arecibo Ionosphere Observatory, where some of my pandemic fieldwork occurred, is a setting in the book. And also, I am an anthropologist. I am Puerto Rican. I draw both from my personal experience and my anthropological lens to make a story that I think is very multicultural and multilingual. It's set in Puerto Rico, but the other half is set in the Yucatán Peninsula in what we'll call the former Maya world. And there's a lot of intersections between the two settings. And that goes back to the deeper Indigenous history. Some people are calling this Indigenous futurism because it references the Taínos, who are the Indigenous people of Puerto Rico, but also the Mayas, and many different Maya groups that are throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, but also present-day Guatemala and Honduras. And the story is about exchange between these two worlds. As someone trained as an anthropologist, it's a really difficult task to kind of pull that off. And I think that my training has really, really helped me achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there any examples of ways being among the MIT community while writing this book influenced and, in some ways, made this project possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; I relied on many of my colleagues for support. There's some sign language in the book. In Puerto Rico, there's a big tradition of sign language. There's a version of American sign language called LSPR that's only found in Puerto Rico. And that's something I've been aware of ever since I was a kid. But I'm not fluent in sign language or deaf communities and their culture. I got a lot of help from &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/hasts/graduate/loh.html"&gt;Timothy Loh&lt;/a&gt;, who's in the HASTS program, who was extremely helpful to steer me towards sensitivity readers in the deaf community in his networks. My advisor&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/stefan-helmreich"&gt;Stefan Helmreich&lt;/a&gt;, is very much a science fiction person in a lot of ways. His research is on the ocean waves, the history and anthropology of biology. He's done ethnography in deep-sea submersibles. He's always kind of thinking in a science fictional lens. And he allowed me, for one of my qualifying exam lists, to mesh science fiction with social theory. And that was also a way that I felt very supported by the Institute. In my coursework, I also took a few science fiction courses in other departments. I worked with &lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/shariann-lewitt/"&gt;Shariann Lewitt&lt;/a&gt;, who actually read the first version of the story. I workshopped it in her 21W.759 (Writing Science Fiction) class, and got some really amazing feedback that led to what is now a publication and a dream fulfilled in so many ways. She took me under her wing and really believed in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the 1550s, a series of English sailing expeditions went searching for a supposed “Northeast Passage” to China, which they hoped to locate near the top of Europe. No one found it — but English sailors did figure out how to routinely reach Russia. The subsequent founding of the Muscovy Company, the first joint stock trading company, provided a model for many similarly-structured later enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“England opened and sustained a direct trade with Muscovy,” says MIT professor Mary Fuller. “The English had been voyaging in a scattershot way. But in the process of this concerted attempt in the 1550s to discover a new route to China, English navigators learned new techniques of mathematical navigation. And so they skilled up. And people on the investment and trade side began to create the management and financial infrastructure to support sustained enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, these are not especially well-known voyages. But to English cleric Richard Hakluyt (1553-1616), one of his country’s leading advocates of overseas exploration, they were highly significant. Spain and Portugal could boast of discovering sea routes to India and the Pacific; the Russian voyages, he claimed, were a sign the English had begun to rival them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hakluyt prominently included accounts of those expeditions in a remarkable compendium he published in 1600, “The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation,” a three-volume, 2,000-page attempt to compile records of all travel English merchants and mariners had taken beyond Europe. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s enormous pride in this,” says Fuller, a professor in MIT’s Literature section who is also chair of the faculty at MIT. “Even though the northern route hadn’t been found, he wants to claim that the effort to find it was itself a world-changing voyage — England was in the game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in her just-released book, “&lt;a href="https://www.mqup.ca/lines-drawn-across-the-globe-products-9780228016762.php" target="_blank"&gt;Lines Drawn across the Globe&lt;/a&gt;,” published by McGill-Queen’s University Press, Fuller provides a new reading of Hakluyt’s famed compendium, broadening our view of his aims, and situating his work in a historical moment when England’s ability to explore the world was unproven. Many things that mattered to Hakluyt, including these 1550s voyages, may be forgotten today, but Fuller’s book reconstructs his priorities, worldview, and methods in rich detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broadening the picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hakluyt lived through a period of substantial change: England may have been trying to catch up to some of its seafaring rivals around the time he was born, but by 1588 had defeated the Spanish Armada. And Hakluyt participated in England’s expansionist project: He was an advocate for and planner of the short-lived Roanoke colony in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As England’s empire reached its furthest extent in the 19th Century, Hakluyt’s work enjoyed a revival; the historian James Froude called Hakluyt’s compendium the “prose epic of the English nation,” and past explorations were used to justify further expansion. “Principal Navigations” documents some of the landmarks of Elizabethan maritime history, including Thomas Harriot’s account of the Roanoke colony; Drake’s circumnavigation of the globe, which lasted from 1577-1580; and material about the 1588 battle with the Spanish Armada. It is no wonder it has become a “founding document of national identity.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But “Principal Navigations”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;contains more than these famous stories, and “Lines Drawn across the Globe” contends that visions of Hakluyt’s vast book as the simple expression of an anti-Catholic, Elizabethan triumphalism miss the mark. For one thing, as Fuller writes, “Hakluyt’s compilation had a more expansive scope than its titular focus on the navigations of the English nation would suggest.” In Hakluyt’s volume on voyages to the Americas, the “Principal Navigations” included substantial translated accounts of French, Portugese, and Spanish voyages. Hakluyt was not only recording English exploits; he was collecting knowledge, including knowledge of what other nations had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lines Drawn across the Globe” also aims to highlight the complexities of the world Hakluyt’s countrymen encountered. At times, English voyagers recognized what they saw as sophisticated and powerful empires, from the Ottoman Empire to the substantial and diverse political and commercial infrastructure of West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ottomans, Muscovites, Spanish, Portugese, and African customs, knowledge, and people were at times derided, excluded, and combatted, at others made the target of imitation, admiration, inclusion, or alliance, admitted as correspondents, enjoys, or brokers,” Fuller writes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many accounts in “Principal Navigations” reflect England’s ongoing rivalry with Spain. The privateer John Hawkins, commanding several vessels in 1567, was trapped and attacked by Spanish forces off the coast of Mexico, escaping (along with a cousin, Francis Drake) but leaving much of his crew behind. This voyage was well-documented; Hawkins, doing damage control, wrote an account in part to “argue that he was a victim of perfidious Spain,” Fuller says, and other narratives tell the stories of crew members who were abandoned, lived as captives in Mexico, and managed eventually to return home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hakluyt used materials like this to suggest the English were on higher moral ground than the Spanish when it came to their treatment of captives or indeed of indigenous Americans. He is silent on other forms of captivity, however. Hawkins had gone to the Caribbean in an attempt to sell slaves seized in West Africa. This experiment with the Atlantic slave trade would not be repeated for decades, but evidence dispersed across Hakluyt’s compendium suggests that was a practical rather ethical choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of material on enslaved people and on trade in slaves that you can’t find unless you look closely,” Fuller says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Hakluyt boasted of English naval victories and values, however, he remained intent on urging his countrymen to emulate their Spanish counterparts.&amp;nbsp; Hakluyt ended “Principal Navigations” not with accounts of raids on the Spanish Americas, but of the Spanish naval institutions he hoped could be “established here with us.” Once a peace was signed, he would resume exchanges with Spanish geographers. Overall, Fuller argues, Hakluyt’s work was more complicated, cosmopolitan, and ecumenical than a focus on its greatest hits would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholarly curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lines Drawn across the Globe” helps fill a void in Elizabethan maritime history; as Fuller notes in the book, there is no modern critical edition of Hakluyt’s book, the last single-author study dates to 1928, and the most recent index (from 1965) covers only the shorter, first edition of the work that appeared in 1589. Through two decades of research on the subject, Fuller says she has been driven by “curiosity about the details and how they fit together.” She adds: “I want to know what actually happened, and that informs how I understand these texts and the projects of their authors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An occasional voyager on seas herself, Fuller has been (with MIT Alumni Travel) to Western Greenland and Hudson Bay, Canada, among other sites. But if she had to pick one place from the “Principal Navigations” to sail to in the future, it would be much further south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I would really like to go through the Straits of Magellan,” Fuller says. “Some of those narratives [from there] are so eerie. It’s really like they’re in another world. And it’s not simply because it’s so dangerous. The narratives about the landscape are sublime and fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have praised “Lines Drawn across the Globe.” Joan-Pau Rubiés, a scholar at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, in Barcelona, calls the book a “magisterial work” and “an indispensable analytical guide to a text whose size and diversity can be daunting.” Daniel Carey of the University of Galway calls it “the most comprehensive guide to reading Hakluyt that is currently available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For her part, Fuller observes that her research subject generated productive discussions with colleagues across many disciplines at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think this project was conditioned in important ways by being here,” Fuller says. “I’ve been here since 1989, and the most interesting thing at MIT, beyond teaching, is getting to know colleagues and having conversations across sometimes really distant disciplinary barriers. Whether it was navigation, the cloth trade, or questions about ocean temperature, this topic lent itself to those kinds of connections. It created a broad network, and that was very useful for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world-famous Bayreuth Festival in Germany, annually centered around the works of composer Richard Wagner, launched this summer on July 25 with a production that has been making headlines. Director &lt;a href="https://www.jayscheib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Scheib&lt;/a&gt;, an MIT faculty member, has created a version of Wagner’s celebrated opera “&lt;a href="https://www.stage-plus.com/video/vod_concert_APNM8GRFDPHMASJKBSPJCE8" target="_blank"&gt;Parsifal&lt;/a&gt;” that is set in an apocalyptic future (rather than the original Medieval past), and uses augmented reality headset technology for a portion of the audience, among other visual effects. People using the headsets see hundreds of additional visuals, from fast-moving clouds to arrows being shot at them. The AR portion of the production was developed through a team led by designer and MIT Technical Instructor &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/joshua-higgason" target="_blank"&gt;Joshua Higgason&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “Parsifal” has engendered extensive media attention and discussion among opera followers and the viewing public. Five years in the making, it was developed with the encouragement of Bayreuth Festival general manager Katharina Wagner, Richard Wagner’s great-granddaughter. The production runs until Aug. 27, and can also be &lt;a href="https://www.stage-plus.com/video/vod_concert_APNM8GRFDPHMASJKBSPJCE8" target="_blank"&gt;streamed on Stage+&lt;/a&gt;. Scheib, the Class of 1949 Professor in MIT’s Music and Theater Arts program, recently talked to &lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; about the project from Bayreuth. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Your production of “Parsifal” led off this year’s entire Bayreuth festival. How’s it going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; From my point of view it’s going quite swimmingly. The leading German opera critics and the audiences have been super-supportive and Bayreuth makes it possible for a work to evolve … Given the complexity of the technical challenge of making an AR project function in an opera house, the bar was so high, it was a difficult challenge, and we’re really happy we found a way forward, a way to make it work, and a way to make it fit into an artistic process. I feel great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You offer a new interpretation of “Parsifal,” and a new setting for it. What is it, and why did you choose to interpret it this way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the main themes in “Parsifal” is that the long-time king of this holy grail cult is wounded, and his wound will not heal. [With that in mind], we looked at what the world was like when the opera premiered in the late 19th century, around the time of what was known as the Great African Scramble, when Europe re-drew the map of Africa, largely based on resources, including mineral resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt remains [the focus of] dirty mining practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and is a requirement for a lot of our electronic objects, in particular batteries. There are also these massive copper deposits discovered under a Buddhist temple in Afghanistan, and lithium under a sacred site in Nevada. We face an intense challenge in climate change, and the predictions are not good. Some of our solutions like electric cars require these materials, so they’re only solutions for some people, while others suffer [where minerals are being mined]. We started thinking about how wounds never heal, and when the prospect of creating a better world opens new wounds in other communities. … That became a theme. It also comes out of the time when we were making it, when Covid happened and George Floyd was murdered, which created an opportunity in the U.S. to start speaking very openly about wounds that have not healed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set it in a largely post-human environment, where we didn’t succeed, and everything has collapsed. In the third act, there’s derelict mining equipment, and the holy water is this energy-giving force, but in fact it’s this lithium-ion pool, which gives us energy and then poisons us. That’s the theme we created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What were your goals about integrating the AR technology into the opera, and how did you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; First, I was working with my collaborator Joshua Higgason. No one had ever really done this before, so we just started researching whether it was possible. And most of the people we talked to said, “Don’t do it. It’s just not going to work.” Having always been a daredevil at heart, I was like, “Oh, come on, we can figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were diligent in exploring the possibilities. We made multiple trips to Bayreuth and made these milimeter-accurate laser scans of the auditorium and the stage. We built a variety of models to see how to make AR work in a large environment, where 2,000 headsets could respond simultaneously. We built a team of animators and developers and programmers and designers, from Portugal to Cambridge to New York to Hungary, the UK, and a group in Germany. Josh led this team, and they got after it, but it took us the better part of two years to make it possible for an audience, some of whom don’t really use smartphones, to put on an AR headset and have it just work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even believe we did this. But it’s working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; In opera there’s hopefully a productive tension between tradition and innovation. How do you think about that when it comes to Wagner at Bayreuth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Innovation is the tradition at Bayreuth. Musically and scenographically. “Parsifal” was composed for this particular opera house, and I’m incredibly respectful of what this event is made for. We are trying to create a balanced and unified experience, between the scenic design and the AR and the lighting and the costume design, and create perfect moments of convergence where you really lose yourself in the environment. I believe wholly in the production and the performers are extraordinary. Truly, truly, truly extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; People have been focused on the issue of bringing AR to Bayreuth, but what has Bayreuth brought to you as a director?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Working in Bayreuth has been an incredible experience. The level of intellectual integrity among the technicians is extraordinary. The amount of care and patience and curiosity and expertise in Bayreuth is off the charts. This community of artists is the greatest. … People come here because it’s an incredible meeting of the minds, and for that I’m immensely filled with gratitude every day I come into the rehearsal room. The conductor, Pablo Heras-Casado, and I have been working on this for several years. And the music is still first. We’re setting up technology not to overtake the music, but to support it, and visually amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be said that Katharina Wagner has been one of the most powerfully supportive artistic directors I have ever worked with. I find it inspiring to witness her tenacity and vision in seeing all of this through, despite the hurdles. It’s been a great collaboration. That’s the essence: great collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This work was supported, in part, by an &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mitnano-immersion-lab-gaming-program-awards-seed-grants-1117" target="_blank"&gt;MIT.nano Immersion Lab Gaming Program seed grant&lt;/a&gt;, and was developed using capabilities in the Immersion Lab. The project was also funded, in part, by a grant from the &lt;a href="http://arts.mit.edu/cast" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline"&gt;MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As negotiations for the Treaty of Lausanne began in late 1922, the aim was to hammer out one last international settlement about territories and rights following the first world war, this time between the victorious Allied powers and the Ankara government that had just abolished the Ottoman sultanate and started governing what would soon become the Republic of Turkey. Those watching the conference closely included Armenian representatives who had survived the genocide led by Ottoman rulers in 1915-16, when hundreds of thousands of Armenians were killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the conference, the Armenian delegation had one major aim: that Armenians be granted an autonomous region within Turkey, either in what is now eastern Turkey or northern Syria. They called this an Armenian National Home (ANH), an autonomous, demilitarized area within Turkish territory where Armenians could practice self-rule and express their culture and religion safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negotiations did not produce what the Armenians wanted, however. Turkish leaders rebuffed Armenian demands, while the Allies were not heavily invested in the matter. The Treaty of Lausanne became known as the “birth certificate” of modern Turkey, while Turkey’s Armenian population became a minority group with mostly equal rights, but often facing discrimination in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Treaty of Lausanne doesn’t mention Armenians even once,” says MIT historian Lerna Ekmekcioglu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a newly published research article, Ekmekcioglu contends that the Treaty of Lausanne is an often-overlooked event of great historical significance for Armenians. As she writes, “the Treaty of Lausanne rendered the Armenian Genocide politically inconsequential.” There was no redress for Armenians, in the form of autonomy or any kind of restorative justice, and no accountability for the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That article, “Debates over an Armenian National Home at the Lausanne Conference and the Limits of Post-Genocide Co-Existence,” uses new archival research to reconstruct the dynamics of the treaty negotiations. As such, the research illuminates both Armenians’ struggles as well as the international community’s struggles to deliver consistent support for multiethnic, multireligious states.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="large"&gt;“The issue broadly is how states govern people whose identities don’t fit with the historically dominant group’s identity,” says Ekmekcioglu, who is the McMillan-Stewart Associate Professor of History at MIT and director of MIT’s Program in Women’s and Gender Studies. “It’s an ongoing question. This is a very good case study for contemplating these questions. It’s also very relevant to this day because the Lausanne Treaty did not collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper appears as a chapter in the edited volume, “&lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/T/bo197934159.html" target="_blank"&gt;They All Made Peace — What Is Peace?: The 1923 Lausanne Treaty and the New Imperial Order&lt;/a&gt;,” published by Gingko and available in the US via the University of Chicago Press. It is edited by Jonathan Conlin, a historian at the University of Southampton, and Ozan Ozavci, an assistant professor at Utrecht University. The volume marks the 100th anniversary of the treaty being signed, which occurred on July 24, 1923.&amp;nbsp;The book is part of a collective scholarly effort about the treaty, the “Lausanne Project,” whose website suggests the pact may be the “forgotten peace” of World War I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekmekcioglu’s past work largely focuses on the lives of Armenians in the modern Turkish state. In her 2016 book, “Recovering Armenia: The Limits of Belonging in Post-Genocide Turkey,” published by Stanford University Press, she notes that immediately after World War I, Armenians were optimistic about their political prospects; Ekmekcioglu calls the time from 1918 to 1922 an “exceptional period,” as Armenians hoped to gain full rights they did not have under the Ottoman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Treaty of Lausanne negotiations — held in Lausanne, Switzerland — brought an end to Armenian optimism. Perhaps that should have been predicted: In the few years after World War I ended, Turkish military forces defeated Allied-backed troops in skirmishing for control over some Turkish territory. That made the Treaty of Lausanne discussions highly unusual: The putative victors, the Allies, had just lost military battles to the side they were negotiating against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They have so much negotiating power that they get most of what they want,” Ekmekcioglu says, speaking of the incipient Turkish government of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense, 1922 was probably already too late for negotiations to deliver success for the Armenians. But as Ekmekcioglu details in the article, the Allies lacked not just military leverage, but perhaps moral standing. The Turkish press ran many stories about colonial misdeeds by the British and French, and even stories about the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S., all aimed at showing that the Allied powers had mistreated minority groups. To whatever extent there may have been Ottoman backing for a new Armenian settlement, that kind of coverage helped squelch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons they [the Allied side] didn’t have much standing in the eyes of the Turkish public is that they confused humanitarianism with colonialism,” Ekmekcioglu says. “They claimed specifically to have never treated any minorities badly in the empire. But Turkish newspapers were writing about that double standard of imperialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treaty of Lausanne has perhaps been best known for having ratified a massive and compulsory population exchange in the 1920s between orthodox Greeks in Asia Minor and surrounding areas, and Muslims in Greece. Perhaps 2 million people were relocated, about three-quarters of them Greek. That exchange, which homogenized area populations, has often been regarded as an antedecdent to the partitioning of India and Pakistan in the late 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has important international legal law consequences because population transfer then becomes a potentially recognized solution to the existence of heterogeneity and population mixing,” Ekmekcioglu observes. “Other groups, in the future will take this as an example. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, while the Treaty of Lausanne did guarantee certain rights for all populations, its inability to deliver a more thorough pluralism in political bodies may be a lasting part of its legacy. To be sure, the Armenian representatives at the Lausanne conference also wanted their own largely homogenized territory, too — although, as Ekmekcioglu notes in the paper, their extraordinary circumstances makes that fairly understandable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, after suffering at the hands of the Ottomans, the Armenians then felt let down by the international community, another blow in short succession. Perhaps there were no easy answers at the time, but, Ekmekcioglu observes, we can still think through what the best alternatives might have been. Especially, she notes, in a world often still struggling to achieve stability and pluralism at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To understand minorities in Turkey to this day, you have to understand the Treaty of Lausanne, and how it came to be,” Ekmekcioglu says. “It’s a great laboratory for comparing, and ideally coming up with an answer to, the issue of difference.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gloria Martinez has a million-and-a-half items on her to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite literally: Give or take a few hundred thousand, that's the number of unique objects in the MIT Museum's astonishingly diverse collection. Martinez is supervising the collection's move to a new storage facility — the final step in delivering the new museum, whose headquarters opened last fall in the heart of Kendall Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a tiny fraction of the huge collection is on display at the popular new museum. Working under tight deadlines, Martinez and her team are painstakingly gathering details on the vast store, now held at a warehouse and at the previous site of the museum, and packing everything for transfer to another storage facility a few miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez, a master of the art and science of handling museum artifacts, faces a bewildering and ever-changing array of logistical challenges. “My day might look one way on my calendar in the morning, and turn into something completely different once I start,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casting a wide net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artifacts such as lab devices, ship models, and architectural plans are critical for understanding the Institute past and present, says Deborah Douglas, the museum's director of collections and curator of science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The museum was formed around its objects, and has been systematically accumulating those artifacts over the past 50 years,” Douglas says. “The aim is not simply to document the triumphs of MIT, but to tell the story of science, technology, architecture, and all of the endeavors that the people of the Institute have engaged with in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It's an encyclopedic collection,” she adds. The treasure trove holds, for example, plans for America’s Cup-winning yachts, 100 years of architecture student thesis drawings (including those of Robert Taylor, the first trained Black architect in the United States), one of the first aluminum-framed bicycles, human-powered airplane parts, holograms (lots of holograms!), thoroughly offbeat lab instruments, folded-paper items, costumes, trophies, massive chunks of physics experiments and early computers, and remnants of MIT's famous hacks, such as a door from the firetruck that appeared on the Great Dome in 2006 to mark the fifth anniversary of 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Florencia Pierri, assistant curator for science and technology, heard about the vast size of collection when she was hired. “But it's different,” she says, “to actually climb a ladder for the first time and survey the rows and rows and rows of 10-foot-tall shelves just chock full of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning the process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawn by the scale of the challenge, Martinez joined the museum in 2019. Collaborating with museum registrar Katie Porter, she began quietly exploring the collection and sketching out plans for the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next year, when the pandemic hit, MIT's lockdown policies drastically shrank the hours that anyone could work at the warehouse. “To be honest, Covid afforded me the opportunity to have that time exclusively just to plan and prepare for the projects,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is common in museums, much of what MIT held was barely described in the museum's collection database. “Gloria insisted on a level of inventory review that will make the collection much more accessible online, so that it will become much easier for people on campus and around the world to understand what we have,” Douglas says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2021, the museum had recruited three assistant curators who could bring their expertise to that job (and were starting to grasp just how much effort it would entail). Martinez also hired and trained a packing team of four people with a background in handling museum items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She constantly revised plans and processes for the move. All of the museum's 20,000-or-so three-dimensional objects needed good photographs, so the team set up an ad hoc but highly effective photo station. Another issue cropped up with the sheer physicality of the objects, which might weigh 80 or 150 pounds. Grappling all day with these might lead to injuries or other accidents, so she aimed to shorten the work sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Processing the endless stream of items can be draining, physically and intellectually,” says Jon Duval, assistant curator of architecture and design. “But it's fun,” he says. “It's a joy to be around people who get equally excited about museum work and about artifacts, and to learn things from everyone else who's there. Or to look at something that we have no idea about, and try to figure out what it might be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It's so great to have a team,” says Elisabeth (“Libby”) Meier, assistant curator for the museum's Hart Nautical Collection. “Gloria is a wizard at scheduling and making sure materials are where they need to be. And working with the other curators on things that aren't in my collection is fascinating, because I generally don't know what's coming out of the box, and they generally do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puzzling out objects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no lack of artifacts that call for quick detective work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the surprises was something that the collection database described simply as a brick. “I noticed it because I tried to move it and it was a lot heavier than I thought it would be,” says Pierri. She discovered that the “brick” was part of a graphite rod created for the world's first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction, at the University of Chicago in 1942.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unexpected find was two empty leather trunks that were falling apart and seemed to be overdue for the trash. But the trunks belonged to Katharine Dexter McCormick, the first woman to earn an MIT science degree and the main source of funding for the development of the first birth control pill. McCormick used the trunks to smuggle diaphragms from Europe to the United States in the 1920s, Pierri says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even stranger curiosity was a box of rusted cans — grocery store items employed in influential experiments with bar codes, says Duval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every surprise during the inventory is so compelling, and not everything is kept. “Maybe we don't need quite so many toenail clippers from the contents of somebody's desk drawer,” Douglas says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting with the collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With steady progress on an upgraded inventory, the packing team moved into high gear last November. Everything will be out of the current warehouse by December 2023, and out of the former museum site by July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martinez keeps fine-tuning her plans as situations and timelines change. “It's been very fluid,” she says. “You can't be rigid in this profession. If you are, you really need to find another job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the last couple of years, we've been doing this nonstop, and it will require a lot more hard work and additional reinforcements” says Martinez, who adds that she's just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gloria has done an extraordinary job,” says Douglas. “She's created a really intelligent approach to inventorying, but then also created a plan for packing all the material that lets us be much more efficient in our moving process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, the goal of all this moving stuff around is to make it even more accessible,” Douglas says. “This is material that you can use to teach with, do research with, stimulate academic and entrepreneurial endeavors, and to educate — whether yourself or the broader community. If we can help inspire people, if we can help educate people, or provide useful resources for the work that's going on today or in the future at MIT and beyond, then we will have accomplished our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Civil discourse project to launch at MIT</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Through a speaker series and activities in the Concourse learning community, the project's leaders aim to promote the value of open discussion on campus.<br>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new project on civil discourse aims to promote open and civil discussion of difficult topics on the MIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project, which will launch this fall, includes a speaker series and curricular activities in &lt;a href="http://concourse.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT’s Concourse program&lt;/a&gt; for first-year students. MIT philosophers Alex Byrne and Brad Skow from the &lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/"&gt;Department of Linguistics and Philosophy&lt;/a&gt; lead the project, in close coordination with Anne McCants, professor of history and director of Concourse, and Linda Rabieh, a Concourse lecturer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.avdf.org/"&gt;Arthur Vining Davis Foundations&lt;/a&gt; provided a substantial grant to help fund the project. Promoting civil discourse on college campuses is an area of focus for AVDF — they sponsor related projects at many schools, including Duke University and Davidson College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first event in the speaker series is planned for the evening of Oct. 24, on the question of how we should respond to climate change. The two speakers are Professor Steven Koonin (New York University, ex-provost of Caltech, and an MIT alum) and MIT Professor Kerry Emanuel from the &lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/"&gt;Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. Eight such events are planned over two years. Each will feature speakers discussing difficult or controversial topics, and will aim to model civil debate and dialogue involving experts from inside and outside the MIT community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byrne and Skow said that the project is meant to counterbalance a growing unwillingness to listen to others or to tolerate the expression of certain ideas. But the goal, says Byrne, “is not to platform heterodox views for their own sake, or to needlessly provoke. Rather, we want to platform collegial, informed conversations on important matters about which there is reasonable disagreement.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faculty at MIT voted last fall to adopt a &lt;a href="https://facultygovernance.mit.edu/sites/default/files/reports/20221221_MIT_Statement_on_Freedom_of_Expression_and_Academic_Freedom.pdf"&gt;statement on free expression&lt;/a&gt;, following a report written by an MIT working group. The project organizers want to build on that vote and the report. “The free expression statement says that discussion of controversial topics should not be prohibited or punished,” Skow says, “but the longer working-group report goes farther, urging MIT to promote free expression. This project is an attempt to do that — to show that open discussion and open inquiry are valuable.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has the potential to generate lively, constructive, respectful discussion on campus and to show by example both that controversial views are not suppressed at MIT and that we learn by engaging with them openly,” says Kieran Setiya, the head of MIT Philosophy. Agustín Rayo, dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, thinks that the project can “play a critical role in demonstrating — to faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends — the Institute’s commitment to free speech and civil discourse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from climate change, topics for the first series of events include feminism and progress (Nov. 9, with Mary Harrington, author of “Feminism against Progress”), and Covid public health policy (Feb. 26, with Vinay Prasad, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco). Organizers say they hope the speaker series becomes a permanent part of MIT’s intellectual life after the grant period. To amplify the work to an audience beyond MIT, the project organizers have partnered with the Johns Hopkins University political scientist Yascha Mounk and his team at &lt;a href="https://www.persuasion.community/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to produce podcast episodes around the speaker events. They will air as special episodes of Mounk’s podcast “&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-good-fight/id1198765424"&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/a&gt;.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Concourse component of the project will take advantage of the small learning community setting to develop the tools and experience for productive disagreement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The core mission of Concourse depends on both the principle of free expression and the practice of civil discourse,” says McCants, “making it a natural springboard for promoting both across the intellectual culture of MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concourse will experiment with, among other things, seminars discussing the history and practice of freedom of expression, roundtable discussions, and student-led debates. &lt;a href="https://braverangels.org/"&gt;Braver Angels&lt;/a&gt;, an organization with the mission of reducing political polarization, is another partner, along with &lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our goal,” says Rabieh, “is to facilitate, in collaboration with Braver Angels, the probing, intense, and often difficult conversations that lie at the heart of the Concourse program and that are the hallmark of education.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The shrine of Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa is a spectacular mosque in Balkh, Afghanistan. Also known as the “Green Mosque” due to the brilliant color of its tiled and painted dome, the intricately decorated building dates to the 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were more accessible, the Green Mosque would attract many visitors. But Balkh is located in northern Afghanistan, roughly 50 miles from the border with Uzbekistan, and few outsiders will ever reach it. Still, anyone can now get a vivid sense of the mosque thanks to MIT’s new “&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/ways-of-seeing/" target="_blank"&gt;Ways of Seeing&lt;/a&gt;” project, an innovative form of historic preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ways of Seeing” uses multiple modes of imagery to produce a rich visual record of four historic building sites in Afghanistan — including colorful 3D still images, virtual reality imagery that takes viewers around and in some cases inside the structures, and exquisite hand-drawn architectural renderings of the buildings. The project’s imagery will be made available for viewing through the MIT Libraries by the end of June, with open access for the public. A subset of curated project materials will also be available through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.archnet.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Archnet&lt;/a&gt;, an open access resource on the built environment of Muslim societies, which is a collaboration between the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/akdc/" target="_blank"&gt;Aga&amp;nbsp;Khan&amp;nbsp;Documentation Center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the MIT Libraries and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://the.akdn/en/how-we-work/our-agencies/aga-khan-trust-culture" target="_blank"&gt;Aga&amp;nbsp;Khan&amp;nbsp;Trust for Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“After the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, Associate Provost Richard Lester convened a set of MIT faculty in a working group to think of what we as a community of scholars could be doing that would be meaningful to people in Afghanistan at this point in time,” says Fotini Christia, an MIT political science professor who led the project. “‘Ways of Seeing’ is a project that I conceived after discussions with that group of colleagues and which is truly in the MIT tradition: It combines field data, technology, and art to protect heritage and serve the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="Title1"&gt;Christia, the Ford International Professor of the Social Sciences and director of the Sociotechnical Systems Research Center at the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, has worked extensively in Afghanistan conducting field research about civil society. She viewed this project as a unique opportunity to construct a detailed, accessible record of remarkable heritage sites — through sophisticated digital elements as well as finely wrought ink drawings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The idea is these drawings would inspire interest and pride in this heritage, a kind of amazement and motivation to preserve this for as long as humanly possible,” says Jelena Pejkovic MArch ’06, a practicing architect who made the large-scale renderings by hand over a period of months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pejkovic adds: “These drawings are extremely time-consuming, and for me this is part of the motivation. They ask you to slow down and pay attention. What can you take in from all this material that we have collected? How do you take time to look, to interpret, to understand what is in front of you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project’s “digital transformation strategy” was led by Nikolaos Vlavianos, a PhD candidate in the Department of Architecture’s Design and Computation group. The group uses cutting-edge technologies and drones to make three-dimensional digital reconstructions of large-scale architectural sites and create immersive experiences in extended reality (XR). Vlavianos also conducts studies of the psychological and physiological responses of humans experiencing such spaces in XR and in person.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I regard this project as an effort toward a broader architectural metaverse consisting of immersive experiences in XR of physical spaces around the world that are difficult or impossible to access due to political, social, and even cultural constraints,” says Vlavianos. “These spaces in the metaverse are information hubs promoting an embodied experiential approach of living, sensing, seeing, hearing, and touching.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasser Rabbat, the Aga Khan Professor and director of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture at MIT, also offered advice and guidance on the early stages of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project — formally titled “Ways of Seeing: Documenting Endangered Built Heritage in Afghanistan” — encompasses imaging of four quite varied historical sites in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the Green Mosque in Balkh; the Parwan Stupa, a Buddhist dome south of Kabul; the tomb of Gawhar Saad, in Herat, in honor of the queen of the emperor of the Timurid, who was herself a highly influential figure in the 14th and 15th centuries; and the Minaret of Jam, a remarkable 200-foot tall tower dating to the 12th century, next to the Hari River in a distant spot in western Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sites thus encompass multiple religions and a diversity of building types. Many are in remote locations within Afghanistan that cannot readily be accessed by visitors — including scholars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ways of Seeing” is supported by a Mellon Faculty Grant from the MIT Center for Art, Science, and Technology (CAST), and by faculty funding from the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS). It is co-presented with the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), the Sociotechnical Systems Research Center (SSRC) at the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, the MIT Department of Political Science, and SHASS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two students from Wellesley College participating in MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), juniors Meng Lu and Muzi Fang, also worked on the project under the guidance of Vlavianos to create a video game for children involving the Gawhar Saad heritage site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate the imagery, the MIT team worked with an Afghan digital production team that was on the ground in the country; they went to the four sites and took thousands of pictures, having been trained remotely by Vlavianos to perform a 3D scanning aerial operation. They were led by Shafic Gawhari, the managing director for Afghanistan at the Moby Group, an international media enterprise; others involved were Mohammad Jan Kamal, Nazifullah Benaam, Warekzai Ghayoor, Rahm Ali Mohebzada, Mohammad Harif Ghobar, and Abdul Musawer Anwari.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journalists documented the sites by collecting 15,000 to 30,000 images, while Vlavianos computationally generated point clouds and mesh geometry with detailed texture mapping. The outcome of those models consisted of still images, &amp;nbsp;immersive&amp;nbsp;experiences&amp;nbsp;in XR, and data for Pejkovic. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“‘Ways of Seeing’ proposes a hybrid model of remote data collection,” says Vlavianos, who in his time at MIT has also led similar projects at Machu Picchu in Peru, and the Simonos Petra monastery at Mount Athos, Greece. To produce similar imagery even more easily, he says, “The next step — which I am working on — is to utilize autonomous drones deployed simultaneously in various locations on the world for rapid production and advanced neural network algorithms to generate models from lower number of images.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, Vlavianos envisions documenting and reconstructing other sites around the world using crowdsourcing data, historical images,&amp;nbsp;satellite imagery, or even by having local communities learn XR techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pejkovic produced her drawings based on the digital models assembled by Vlavianos, carefully using a traditional rendering technique in which she would first outline the measurements of each structure, at scale, and then gradually ink in the drawings to give the buildings texture. The inking technique she used is based on VERNADOC, a method of documenting vernacular architecture developed by the Finnish architect Markku Mattila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="x"&gt;“I wanted to rediscover the most traditional possible kind of documentation — measuring directly by hand, and drawing by hand,” says Pejkovic. She has been active in conservation of cultural heritage for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time Pejkovic ever saw this type of hand-drawn renderings in person, she recalls thinking, “This is not possible, a human being cannot make drawings like this.” However, she wryly adds, “You know the motto at MIT is ‘mens et manus,’ mind and hand.” And so she embarked on hand drawing these renderings herself, at a large scale — her image of the Minaret of Jam has been printed in a crisp 8-foot version by the MIT team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ultimate intent of this project has been to make all these outputs, which are co-owned with the Afghans who carried out the data collection on the ground, available to Afghan refugees displaced around the world but also accessible to anyone keen to witness them,” Christia says. “The digital twins [representations] of these sites are also meant to work as repositories of information for any future preservation efforts. This model can be replicated and scaled for other heritage sites at risk from wars, environmental disaster, or cultural appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you’re searching for a podcast about the intersections between poetic and technical knowledge, look no further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/2171040" target="_blank"&gt;Poetechnics&lt;/a&gt; is a new audio series from the MIT Literature Section produced by Lecturer &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/michael-lutz/" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Lutz&lt;/a&gt;, whose scholarly interests include early modern British literature and culture; media studies, including digital media and videogames; philosophy and literature; and the history of humanism and the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through discussions with MIT faculty, staff, students, and guests, Poetechnics offers perspectives on the benefits of literary and humanistic study combined with scientific and technical pursuits, and what closer integration of these approaches to learning might look like in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/litmit-the-poetechnics-podcast-ep-1-a-conversation-with-malka-older/"&gt;premier episode,&lt;/a&gt; Lutz hosts a discussion with sociologist, humanitarian, and speculative fiction author &lt;a href="https://malkaolder.wordpress.com/"&gt;Malka Older&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(“Infomacracy,”&amp;nbsp;“The Mimicking of Known Successes”) about society, literature, and speculation. Joining them are MIT Lecturer &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/jterrones/"&gt;Joaquin Terrones&lt;/a&gt; and graduate student and speculative fiction author&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://egconde.com/"&gt;Steve Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of MIT’s Doctoral Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Poetechnics’ &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/litmit-the-poetechnics-podcast-ep-2-wyn-kelley/" target="_blank"&gt;second episode&lt;/a&gt;, Lutz discusses teaching, research, and Herman Melville’s technology of the semicolon with Literature Section Senior Lecturer &lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/wkelley/"&gt;Wyn Kelley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m really excited for the opportunity to lead these discussions and provide a glimpse of the wide variety of playful, creative, and insightful thinking that goes on in the Literature Section for people on campus and beyond," says Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is generously supported, in part, by MIT’s d’Arbeloff Fund for Excellence in Education.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>An AI challenge only humans can solve</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/power-and-progress-book-ai-inequality-0517</link>
  <description><![CDATA[In their new book, “Power and Progress,” Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson ask whether the benefits of AI will be shared widely or feed inequality.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/power-and-progress-book-ai-inequality-0517</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Dark Ages were not entirely dark. Advances in agriculture and building technology increased Medieval wealth and led to a wave of cathedral construction in Europe. However, it was a time of profound inequality. Elites captured virtually all economic gains. In Britain, as Canterbury Cathedral soared upward, peasants had no net increase in wealth between 1100 and 1300. Life expectancy hovered around 25 years. Chronic malnutrition was rampant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been struggling to share prosperity for a long time,” says MIT Professor Simon Johnson. “Every cathedral that your parents dragged you to see in Europe is a symbol of despair and expropriation, made possible by higher productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a glance, this might not seem relevant to life in 2023. But Johnson and his MIT colleague Daron Acemoglu, both economists, think it is. Technology drives economic progress. As innovations take hold, one perpetual question is: Who benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This applies, the scholars believe, to automation and artificial intelligence, which is the focus of a new book by Acemoglu and Johnson, “Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,” published this week by PublicAffairs. In it, they examine who reaped the rewards from past innovations and who may gain from AI today, economically and politically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The book is about the choices we make with technology,” Johnson says. “That’s a very MIT type of theme. But a lot of people feel technology just descends on you, and you have to live with it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI could develop as a beneficial force, Johnson says. However, he adds, “Many algorithms are being designed to try to replace humans as much as possible. We think that’s entirely wrong. The way we make progress with technology is by making machines useful to people, not displacing them. In the past we have had automation, but with new tasks for people to do and sufficient countervailing power in society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, AI is a tool of social control for some governments that also creates riches for a small number of people, according to Acemoglu and Johnson. “The current path of AI is neither good for the economy nor for democracy, and these two problems, unfortunately, reinforce each other,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A return to shared prosperity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Johnson have collaborated before; in the early 2000s, with political scientist James Robinson, they produced influential papers about politics and economic progress. Acemoglu, an Institute Professor at MIT, also co-authored with Robinson the books “Why Nations Fail” (2012), about political institutions and growth, and “The Narrow Corridor” (2019), which casts liberty as the never-assured outcome of social struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson, the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, wrote “13 Bankers” (2010), about finance reform, and, with MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, “Jump-Starting America” (2019), a call for more investment in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Power and Progress,” the authors emphasize that technology has created remarkable long-term benefits. As they write, “we are greatly better off than our ancestors,” and “scientific and technological progress is a vital part of that story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, a lot of suffering and oppression has occurred while the long term is unfolding, and not just during Medieval times. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a 100-year struggle during the Industrial Revolution for workers to get any cut of these massive productivity gains in textiles and railways,” Johnson observes. Broader progress has come through increased labor power and electoral government; when the U.S. economy grew spectacularly for three decades after World War II, gains were widely distributed, though that has not been the case recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re suggesting we can get back onto that path of shared prosperity, reharness technology for everybody, and get productivity gains,” Johnson says. “We had all that in the postwar period. We can get it back, but not with the current form of our machine intelligence obsession. That, we think, is undermining prosperity in the U.S. and around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A call for “machine usefulness,” not “so-so automation” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do Acemoglu and Johnson think is deficient about AI? For one thing, they believe the development of AI is too focused on mimicking human intelligence. The scholars are skeptical of the notion that AI mirrors human thinking all told — even things like the chess program AlphaZero, which they regard more as a specialized set of instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, for instance, image recognition programs — Is that a husky or a wolf? — use large data sets of past human decisions to build predictive models. But these are often correlation-dependent (a husky is more likely to be in front of your house), and can’t replicate the same cues humans rely on. Researchers know this, of course, and keep refining their tools. But Acemoglu and Robinson contend that many AI programs are less agile than the human mind, and suboptimal replacements for it, even as AI is designed to replace human work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu, who has published many papers on automation and robots, calls these replacement tools “so-so technologies.” A supermarket self-checkout machine does not add meaningful economic productivity; it just transfers work to customers and wealth to shareholders. Or, among more sophisticated AI tools, for instance, a customer service line using AI that doesn’t address a given problem can frustrate people, leading them to vent once they do reach a human and making the whole process less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All told, Acemoglu and Johnson write, “neither traditional digital technologies nor AI can perform essential tasks that involve social interaction, adaptation, flexibility, and communication.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, growth-minded economists prefer technologies creating “marginal productivity” gains, which compel firms to hire more workers. Instead of aiming to eliminate medical specialists like radiologists, a much-forecast AI development that has not occurred, Acemoglu and Johnson suggest AI tools might expand what home health care workers can do, and make their services more valuable, without reducing workers in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think there is a fork in the road, and it’s not too late — AI is a very good opportunity to reassert machine usefulness as a philosophy of design,” Johnson says. “And to look for ways to put tools in the hands of workers, including lower-wage workers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of AI issues Acemoglu and Johnson are concerned about extend directly into politics: Surveillance technologies, facial-recognition tools, intensive data collection, and AI-spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys AI to create “social credit” scores for citizens, along with heavy surveillance, while tightly restricting freedom of expression. Elsewhere, social media platforms use algorithms to influence what users see; by emphasizing “engagement” above other priorities, they can spread harmful misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, throughout “Power and Progress,” Acemoglu and Johnson emphasize that the use of AI can set up self-reinforcing dynamics in which those who benefit economically can gain political influence and power at the expense of wider democratic participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To alter this trajectory, Acemoglu and Johnson advocate for an extensive menu of policy responses, including data ownership for internet users (an idea of technologist Jaron Lanier); tax reform that rewards employment more than automation; government support for a diversity of high-tech research directions; repealing Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from regulation or legal action based on the content they host; and a digital advertising tax (aimed to limit the profitability of algorithm-driven misinformation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson believes people of all ideologies have incentives to support such measures: “The point we’re making is not a partisan point,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other scholars have praised “Power and Progress.” Michael Sandel, the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University, has called it a “humane and hopeful book” that “shows how we can steer technology to promote the public good,” and is “required reading for everyone who cares about the fate of democracy in a digital age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, Acemoglu and Johnson want to broaden the public discussion of AI beyond industry leaders, discard notions about the AI inevitability, and think again about human agency, social priorities, and economic possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Debates on new technology ought to center not just on the brilliance of new products and algorithms but on whether they are working for the people or against the people,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need these discussions,” Johnson says. “There’s nothing inherent in technology. It’s within our control. Even if you think we can’t say no to new technology, you can channel it, and get better outcomes from it, if you talk about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On a recent evening at MIT, over a hundred people gathered at Boynton Hall for a conversation with Amgen Professor of Biology Emerita&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/nancy-hopkins/"&gt;Nancy Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and journalist Kate Zernike. The topic of discussion was Zernike’s book, “The Exceptions: Nancy Hopkins, MIT, and the Fight for Women in Science,” which made its official debut at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Exceptions” centers on Hopkins’ remarkable life and career and tells the story of 16 “exceptional” female scientists on the MIT faculty, who, with Hopkins as their unlikely leader, became heroes in the fight for gender equality. As a result of their work, in 1999 MIT publicly admitted to discriminating against its female faculty, a move that forced academic institutions across the country to reckon with pervasive sexism in science. Kate Zernike, now a correspondent at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, was a reporter at &lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe &lt;/em&gt;at the time and was the first to break the story of MIT’s historic admission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion, which fittingly took place on International Women’s Day, began with an introduction from Nergis Mavalvala, the Curtis and Kathleen Marble Professor of Astrophysics and dean of the School of Science, who sponsored the event with the Department of Biology. After welcoming attendees, both in-person and virtual, she shared an anecdote about the tools that scientists use to measure things. “I’m an experimental physicist,” she explained. “My entire research career has been spent measuring very, very precise distances.” As a result, Mavalvala was fascinated with one particular incident from Hopkins’ career, which is chronicled in chapter 15 of “The Exceptions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1973, Hopkins became an assistant professor at MIT’s Center for Cancer Research, which would later become the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. She spent more than a decade mapping RNA tumor virus genes before switching research fields to develop molecular technologies for working with zebra fish. The work required funding, equipment, and — most importantly — more space in which to house her fish tanks. But Hopkins’s male colleagues routinely took up more than their fair share of all of those resources. After more than 10 years at MIT, Hopkins still had less laboratory space than any other senior faculty member in the building. The head of the cancer center refused to believe that things were so unequal, so one night in 1993, Hopkins got down on her hands and knees with a measuring tape and proved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mavalvala, whose research depends on precise measurement, found herself particularly affected by the story. “I have this newfound regard for the lowly measuring tape,” she declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The story struck me, in a way that I think you more than any other audience can appreciate, as very MIT,” Zernike recalled to the attendees. This sort of thing could only happen, she thought, at an institution whose Latin motto translates to “mind and hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Zernike’s editor tipped her off that something was happening at MIT regarding gender discrimination, she had initially been skeptical. It was 1999, and so many doors had already been opened for women — surely the fight for equality was pretty much over. If few women pursued careers in science, perhaps they just weren’t interested. Science, after all, was a meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopkins had spent much of her career assuming the same thing. For decades, she dealt with subtle and blatant instances of discrimination. She was told she could not teach genetics on the grounds that students wouldn’t trust information coming from a female professor. Despite years of hard work and numerous ingenious discoveries, she struggled to obtain tenure. And she simply wasn’t getting the same respect, money, or space that the men on the faculty did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopkins eventually joined forces with 15 other women on the MIT science faculty to bring the issue of gender discrimination to light. After four years of work, and with the unexpected endorsement of the university administration, they produced the 1999 “&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html"&gt;A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the study suggested that science was not, in fact, a meritocracy. Women were interested in pursuing degrees and careers in science, but they encountered barriers every step of the way. Between blatant acts of discrimination as well as unconscious bias, it was simply more difficult to make it as a woman in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zernike adored that these women had addressed the problem the same way they would a science experiment — with rigorous data analysis and an MIT mindset. But she was equally fascinated by MIT’s response to the study results — their willingness to admit shortcomings, and their dedication to making things better. “In my business,” said Zernike, “that’s known as a man-bites-dog story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Zernike chose the title her book to refer to the 16 “exceptional” female scientists who had the courage to openly acknowledge and fight back against discrimination, she also said it could apply as well to the Institute’s administration, which admitted wrongdoing and made significant changes as a result. “I would say that MIT itself is the exception for having done this,” Zernike said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following her remarks, Zernike was joined on stage by Hopkins for a conversation about the writing of “The Exceptions.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Hopkins described knowing early on that her story and the stories of the 15 other female faculty members were exceptional and that they would need an “exceptional writer.” “You have to have a rigorous &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reporter,” she joked. “Somebody who gets the dirt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event ended with an audience Q&amp;amp;A session, during which audience members, including current MIT students, expressed frustration with the continued impact of sexism in science, and Zernike and Hopkins discussed the work that still remains to be done to achieve equality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT's Program in Women's and Gender Studies &lt;a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/event/the_book_and_the_story_behind_it_the_exceptions_nancy_hopkins_mit_and_the_fight_for_women_in_science_by_kate_zernike#.ZEqI63bMJD8"&gt;hosted a similar discussion&lt;/a&gt; on April 26. Moderated by Ruth Perry, professor emerita of literature, the event featured a panel including Zernike; Hopkins; Leigh Royden, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Geology and Geophysics in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences; Lorna Gibson, the Matoula S. Salapatas Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, a professor of mechanical engineering and MacVicar Fellow in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering; and&amp;nbsp;Sangeeta Bhatia, the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and a professor of electrical engineering and computer science. The event was co-sponsored by the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences' programs in History, STS, Literature, and Comparative Media Studies/Writing.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>How a new sound hit center stage</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Joshua Bennett’s latest book chronicles how the spoken-word poetry movement took hold in America.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1973, Miguel Algarín, an assistant professor in the English Department at Rutgers University, started inviting friends over to his Manhattan apartment for a weekly poetry session where they would read their material, edit each other’s work, and push each other creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, these meetings outgrew Algarín’s living room and moved to a venue he helped found on the Lower East Side of Manhattan — the Nuyorican Poets Café, which by the 1990s became the leading poetry performance space in the U.S., famed as the home of poetry slams, or competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nuyorican Poets Café is not where the poetry slam originated, however. That was at a place called the Get Me High Lounge in Chicago, in the mid-1980s, following the lead of a poetry-loving construction worker, Marc Smith. These competitions soon spread across the U.S., fueled by practitioners who wanted to craft poetry designed for performance. In so doing, these participants revitalized an age-old art form — which has since spread through films, television shows like HBO’s early-2000s “Def Poetry” series, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this was inevitable, however. It took dedication from artists who — like their art form — had been marginalized by existing cultural institutions and wound up building some of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite incredible to see how these friendships, and chance meetings in bars and cafes and performance venues, helped create a sound that we hear across the world,” says Joshua Bennett, a prominent performance poet, author, and MIT scholar. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Bennett explores this landscape in a new book, “Spoken Word: A Cultural History,” just published by Knopf. In it, Bennett chronicles multiple strands of the spoken-word poetry movement, provides vivid portraits of key figures within it, and recounts his own career to date, often in relation to the growth of the genre itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m tracing together individual points of contact, people I’ve met over my life and venues I’ve performed in, while creating this much larger history that spans about 50 years,” says Bennett, who is currently a visiting professor at MIT and will be joining the faculty full-time this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling the room on a Friday night &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To write “Spoken Word,” Bennett conducted archival research, digging into old newspapers, documents, and manuscripts, while interviewing major poets and other facilitators of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people Bennett discusses in the book have had multilayered artistic sensibilities. Algarín often taught Shakespeare to his students, while working to spotlight contemporary poets who were Black, Puerto Rican, or from other cultures overlooked by arts institutions. In his view, there was no insuperable distinction between these poetic forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He [Shakespeare] wanted to have a place to tell the story of England; so I wanted to have a place in which to tell the story of the Lower East Side,” Algarín once explained. The term “Nuyorican” itself is a fusion, of “New York” and “Puerto Rican” (which, as Bennett notes, Algarín first encountered as a word of derision, then adopted as a term of honor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitive aspect of poetry slams has turned out to have multiple benefits, providing motivation for performers and helping shape the spoken-word style. Not least, it has proven very popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a way to get people in the door,” Bennett observes. “Competition is helpful sometimes, a competitive framing. This is an age-old adage in poetry slam: The point isn’t the points, the point is the poetry. But we’re still very competitive about it. And it is good to get people in there on a Friday night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the format has helped highlight new voices, not just familiar faces. Saul Williams, the poet, actor, songwriter, and musician, was a theater student at New York University who in the mid-1990s decided to perform the only poem he had written, at the Brooklyn Moon Café. Williams’ rendition of the work, “Amethyst Rocks,” created a sensation; soon he became Grand Slam Champion of the Nuyorican Poets Café, and launched a career in film, music, and verse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An organized team sport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, Bennett also situates the spoken-word movement in relationship to the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s, which sought new modes of expression, pedagogy, and organization. Bennett himself began performing poetry as a child, encouraged by his parents, and became a standout in college poetry slams while at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate, Bennett was even invited to perform at the White House in 2009 — at an event where Lin-Manuel Miranda also offered the first-ever public performance of material from his soon-to-be blockbuster musical, “Hamilton.” There, Bennett &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U5BwD8zOeM" target="_blank"&gt;performed “Tamara’s Opus,”&lt;/a&gt; a poem about his deaf sister that offers an apology for his own slow adoption of sign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bennett makes clear, the spoken-word movement has helped generate cultural organizations, community programs, and college competitions such as the ones that earned him notice, providing structure, training, and socially grounded opportunities for creativity. Such programs also give young people valuable writing and public-speaking skills. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is where we need to be investing as a country,” Bennett says. “Not just because we want to help train a larger number of poets — though it would be cool, it would be amazing — but because it’s a toolkit you can take into any other field of human endeavor, whether you’re a lawyer, journalist, teacher, nurse, doctor. Being able to memorize long passages and speak in front of people without fear — that’s important. Spoken word and poetry slam in particular helps you to master that skill. You have three minutes to get across a point of view. That’s a real training ground, and it’s been proven out over the last 30 or 40 years — through a generation of writers, intellectuals, and changemakers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going digital, and going global&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 2010s, Bennett also helped found Strivers Row, a poetry collaborative with a strong online presence. It was soon followed by another group, Button Poetry, a hybrid of a YouTube channel and publisher with a million followers online. The two groups have helped show that online performance is a viable commercial pathway for poets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is this whole digital component that I think is actually quite beautiful and important as a way of taking up this ancient art form and getting it out to people who need it, across the world,” Bennett says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spoken Word” has received praise from many quarters. Therí A. Pickens, a professor of English at Bates College, has said that “Bennett captures lightning in a bottle: not just a few of spoken word’s historical touchstones, but glimpses of all that the form has wrought in its various illustrious afterlives.” Writing in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, Tas Tobey called it a “vibrant cultural history” and an “engaging meditation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spoken Word” is a distinctive part of Bennett’s own published output, which incluces the poetry collection, “The Sobbing School” (2016), and “Being Once Property Myself” (2020), a work of historical literary criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, after Bennett performed at the White House, he recalls, “I went back to my hotel room, and I felt this intense pressure. … What would I ever do to top this?” His answer over time has been to keep pursuing spoken-word poetry as a writer and performer, while spreading the joy of poetry as a teacher, and even a parent reading verse to his child. As a distinctive new history of the movement, “Spoken Word” is part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do I top this? Well, I’ll go out and live,” Bennett says. “I’ll go out and live a life that’s hopefully worthy of this tradition. And I’ll pass that tradition on to my children, and to my students. That’s the joy of my life, being a father and husband and professor who has a chance to talk about poems every week with brilliant students. What an opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Exploring new sides of climate and sustainability research</title>

  <description><![CDATA[With the support of each other and MIT faculty, students in the MCSC’s Climate and Sustainability Scholars Program are making their impact on real-world climate challenges.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Molly Chase | Climate and Sustainability Consortium</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC) launched its &lt;a href="https://impactclimate.mit.edu/get-involved/student-opportunities/climate-sustainability-scholars-program/"&gt;Climate and Sustainability Scholars Program&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2022, the goal was to offer undergraduate students a unique way to develop and implement research projects with the strong support of each other and MIT faculty. Now into its second semester, the program is underscoring the value of fostering this kind of network&amp;nbsp;— a community with MIT students at its core, exploring their diverse interests and passions in the climate and sustainability realms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inspired by MIT’s successful &lt;a href="https://superurop.mit.edu/"&gt;SuperUROP&lt;/a&gt; [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program],&amp;nbsp;the yearlong MCSC Climate and Sustainability Scholars Program includes a classroom component combined with experiential learning opportunities and mentorship, all centered on climate and sustainability topics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Harnessing the innovation, passion, and expertise of our talented students is critical to MIT’s mission of tackling the climate crisis,” says Anantha P. Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering, Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and chair of the MCSC.&amp;nbsp;“The program is helping train students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds to be effective leaders in climate and sustainability-focused roles in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we found inspiring about MIT’s existing SuperUROP program was how it provides students with the guidance, training, and resources they need to investigate the world’s toughest problems,” says Elsa Olivetti, the Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Associate Professor in Materials Science and Engineering and MCSC co-director. “This incredible level of support and mentorship encourages students to think and explore in creative ways, make new connections, and develop strategies and solutions that propel their work forward.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first and current cohort of Climate and Sustainability Scholars consists of 19 students, representing MIT’s School of Engineering, MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, School of Science, School of Architecture and Planning, and MIT Sloan School of Management. These students are learning new perspectives, approaches, and angles in climate and sustainability — from each other, MIT faculty, and industry professionals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Projects with real-world applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Students in the program work directly with faculty and principal investigators across MIT to develop their research projects focused on a large scope of sustainability topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This broad scope is important,” says Desirée Plata, MIT’s Gilbert W. Winslow Career Development Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering, “because climate and sustainability solutions are needed in every facet of society. For a long time, people were searching for a ‘silver bullet’ solution to the climate change problems, but we didn’t get to this point with a single technological decision. This problem was created across a spectrum of sociotechnological activities, and fundamentally different thinking across a spectrum of solutions is what’s needed to move us forward. MCSC students are working to provide those solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate student and physics major M. (MG) Geogdzhayeva is working with &lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/raffaele"&gt;Raffaele Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Oceanography in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, and director of the Program in Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, on their project “Using Continuous Time Markov Chains to Project Extreme Events under Climate.” Geogdzhayeva’s research supports the &lt;a href="https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/flagship-projects/bringing-computation-to-the-climate-challenge/"&gt;Flagship Climate Grand Challenges project&lt;/a&gt; that Ferrari is leading along with Professor &lt;a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/selin"&gt;Noelle Eckley Selin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The project I am working on has a similar approach to the Climate Grand Challenges project entitled 'Bringing computation to the climate challenge,'” says Geogdzhayeva. “I am designing an emulator for climate extremes. Our goal is to boil down climate information to what is necessary and to create a framework that can deliver specific information — in order to develop valuable forecasts. As someone who comes from a physics background, the Climate and Sustainability Scholars Program has helped me think about how my research fits into the real world, and how it could be implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating technology and stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within technology development, Jade Chongsathapornpong, also a physics major, is diving into photo-modulated catalytic reactions for clean energy applications. Chongsathapornpong, who has worked with the MCSC on &lt;a href="https://impactclimate.mit.edu/our-work/carbon-capture-utilization-storage/"&gt;carbon capture and sequestration&lt;/a&gt; through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (&lt;a href="https://impactclimate.mit.edu/urop-perspectives-reports/"&gt;UROP&lt;/a&gt;), is now working with &lt;a href="https://dmse.mit.edu/people/harry-l-tuller"&gt;Harry Tuller&lt;/a&gt;, MIT’s R.P. Simmons Professor of Ceramics and Electronic Materials. Louise Anderfaas, majoring in materials science and engineering, is also working with Tuller on her project “Robust and High Sensitivity Detectors for Exploration of Deep Geothermal Wells.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two other students who have worked with the MCSC through UROP include Paul Irvine, electrical engineering and computer science major, who is now researching American conservatism’s current relation to and views about sustainability and climate change, and Pamela Duke, management major, now investigating the use of simulation tools to empower industrial decision-makers around climate change action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other projects focusing on technology development include the experimental characterization of poly(arylene ethers) for energy-efficient propane/propylene separations by Duha Syar, who is a chemical engineering major and working with &lt;a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/zachary-p-smith/"&gt;Zachary Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering; developing methods to improve sheet steel recycling by Rebecca Lizarde, who is majoring in materials science and engineering; and ion conduction in polymer-ceramic composite electrolytes by Melissa Stok, also majoring in materials science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project is very closely connected to developing better Li-Ion batteries, which are extremely important in our transition towards clean energy,” explains Stok, who is working with &lt;a href="https://dmse.mit.edu/people/bilge-yildiz"&gt;Bilge Yildiz&lt;/a&gt;, MIT’s Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering. “Currently, electric cars are limited in their range by their battery capacity, so working to create more effective batteries with higher energy densities and better power capacities will help make these cars go farther and faster. In addition, using safer materials that do not have as high of an environmental toll for extraction is also important.” Claire Kim, a chemical engineering major, is focusing on batteries as well, but is honing in on large form factor batteries more relevant for grid-scale energy storage with &lt;a href="https://cheme.mit.edu/profile/fikile-r-brushett/"&gt;Fikile Brushett&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of chemical engineering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some students in the program chose to focus on stakeholders, which, when it comes to climate and sustainability, can range from entities in business and industry to farmers to Indigenous people and their communities. Shivani Konduru, an electrical engineering and computer science major, is exploring the “backfire effects” in climate change communication, focusing on perceptions of climate change and how the messenger may change outcomes, and Einat Gavish, mathematics major, on how different stakeholders perceive information on driving behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two students are researching the impact of technology on local populations. Anushree Chaudhuri, who is majoring in urban studies and planning, is working with &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/lawrence-susskind"&gt;Lawrence Susskind&lt;/a&gt;, Ford Professor of Urban and Environmental Planning, on community acceptance of renewable energy siting, and Amelia Dogan, also an urban studies and planning major,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is working with &lt;a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/people/danielle-wood/"&gt;Danielle Wood&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics and media arts and sciences, on Indigenous data sovereignty in environmental contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am interviewing Indigenous environmental activists for my project,” says Dogan. “This course is the first one directly related to sustainability that I have taken, and I am really enjoying it. It has opened me up to other aspects of climate beyond just the humanity side, which is my focus. I did MIT’s SuperUROP program and loved it, so was excited to do this similar opportunity with the climate and sustainability focus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other projects include in-field monitoring of water quality by Dahlia Dry, a physics major; understanding carbon release and accrual in coastal wetlands by Trinity Stallins, an urban studies and planning major; and investigating enzyme synthesis for bioremediation by Delight Nweneka, an electrical engineering and computer science major, each linked to the MCSC’s impact pathway work in &lt;a href="https://impactclimate.mit.edu/our-work/natural-carbon-sinks/"&gt;nature-based solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide range of research topics underscores the Climate and Sustainability Program’s goal of bringing together diverse interests, backgrounds, and areas of study even within the same major. For example, Helena McDonald is studying pollution impacts of rocket launches, while Aviva Intveld is analyzing the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment background of the first peopling of the Americas. Both students are Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences majors but are researching climate impacts from very different perspectives. Intveld was recently named a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/aviva-intveld-named-2023-gates-cambridge-scholar-0303"&gt;2023 Gates Cambridge Scholar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are students represented from several majors in the program, and some people are working on more technical projects, while others are interpersonal. Both approaches are really necessary in the pursuit of climate resilience,” says Grace Harrington, who is majoring in civil and environmental engineering and whose project investigates ways to optimize the power of the wind farm. “I think it’s one of the few classes I’ve taken with such an interdisciplinary nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives and guidance from MIT and industry experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As students are developing these projects, they are also taking the program’s course (Climate.UAR), which covers key topics in climate change science, decarbonization strategies, policy, environmental justice, and quantitative methods for evaluating social and environmental impacts. The course is cross-listed in departments across all five schools and is taught by an experienced and interdisciplinary team. Desirée Plata was central to developing the Climate and Sustainability Scholars Programs and course with Associate Professor Elsa Olivetti, who taught the first semester. Olivetti is now co-teaching the second semester with Jeffrey C. Grossman, the Morton and Claire Goulder and Family Professor in Environmental Systems, head of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and MCSC co-director. The course’s writing instructors are Caroline Beimford and David Larson. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have been introduced to a lot of new angles in the climate space through the weekly guest lecturers, who each shared a different sustainability-related perspective,” says Claire Kim. “As a chemical engineering major, I have mostly looked into the technologies for decarbonization, and how to scale them, so learning about policy, for example, was helpful for me. Professor Black from the Department of History spoke about how we can analyze the effectiveness of past policy to guide future policy, while Professor Selin talked about framing different climate policies as having co-benefits. These perspectives are really useful because no matter how good a technology is, you need to convince other people to adopt it, or have strong policy in place to encourage its use, in order for it to be effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing the industry perspective, guests have presented from MCSC &lt;a href="https://impactclimate.mit.edu/current-members/"&gt;member companies&lt;/a&gt; such as PepsiCo, Holcim, Apple, Cargill, and Boeing. As an example, in one class, climate leaders from three companies presented together on their approaches to setting climate goals, barriers to reaching them, and ways to work together. “When I presented to the class, alongside my counterparts at Apple and Boeing, the student questions pushed us to explain how can collaborate on ways to achieve our climate goals, reflecting the broader opportunity we find within the MCSC,” says Dana Boyer, sustainability manager at Cargill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witnessing the cross-industry dynamics unfold in class was particularly engaging for the students. “The most beneficial part of the program for me is the number of guest lectures who have come in to the class, not only from MIT but also from the industry side,” Grace Harrington adds. “The diverse range of people talking about their own fields has allowed me to make connections between all my classes.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bringing in perspectives from both academia and industry is a reflection of the MCSC’s larger mission of linking its corporate members with each other and with the MIT community to develop scalable climate solutions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“In addition to focusing on an independent research project and engaging with a peer community, we've had the opportunity to hear from speakers across the sustainability space who are also part of or closely connected to the MIT ecosystem,” says Anushree Chaudhuri. “These opportunities have helped me make connections and learn about initiatives at the Institute that are closely related to existing or planned student sustainability projects. These connections — across topics like waste management, survey best practices, and climate communications — have strengthened student projects and opened pathways for future collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a positive impact as students and after graduation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the program, students identified several goals, including developing focused independent research questions, drawing connections and links with real-world challenges, strengthening their critical thinking skills, and reflecting on their future career ambitions. A common thread throughout them all: the commitment to having a meaningful impact on climate and sustainability challenges both as students now, and as working professionals after graduation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“I've absolutely loved connecting with like-minded peers through the program. I happened to know most of the students coming in from various other communities on campus, so it's been a really special experience for all of these people who I couldn't connect with as a cohesive cohort before to come together. Whenever we have small group discussions in class, I'm always grateful for the time to learn about the interdisciplinary research projects everyone is involved with,” concludes Chaudhuri. “I'm looking forward to staying in touch with this group going forward, since I think most of us are planning on grad school and/or careers related to climate and sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MCSC Climate and Sustainability Scholars Program is representative of MIT’s ambitious and bold initiatives on climate and sustainability — bringing together faculty and students across MIT to collaborate with industry on developing climate and sustainability solutions in the context of undergraduate education and research.

  <description><![CDATA[MIT scholar Mikael Jakobsson’s new book examines the not-so-subtle worldview contained in many prominent board games.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/mikael-jakobsson-book-board-games-frontiers-0405</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News Office</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The popular board game “Puerto Rico,” dating to 2002, features sophisticated rules and heavily rewards skill, not chance, as players attempt to create 19th-century economic growth on the island. Many people have found it compelling but haven’t delved into its implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I played that game without thinking about it too much,” says Mikael Jakobsson, a lecturer in MIT’s Comparative Media Studies/Writing Program and research coordinator in the MIT Game Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Jakobsson started thinking about it a little more. “Puerto Rico” is set during the period of Spanish colonial rule, and players are trying to build up plantations. Brown disks, representing labor, arrive on ships from overseas, in a place where slavery was not banned until 1873. Players ship all their plantation products overseas. Upon further review, many of the game’s elements seem problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The bigger picture is, you’re playing [the role of] colonizing slave owners competing to be the most efficient in terms of exploiting the island and sending all the resources back to Europe,” Jakobsson says. “When you take a step back and look at what you’re doing, it’s pretty abhorrent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking another step back, as enjoyable as this pastime is — “I love board games,” says Jakobsson — many games merit closer scrutiny. Now Jakobsson and Mary Flanagan, a professor at Dartmouth College, explore the subject in a new book, “Playing Oppression: The Legacy of Conquest and Empire in Colonialist Board Games,” just published by the MIT Press. In it, they delve into the history of board games, and analyze the assumptions baked into many of them — the things we often ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing along&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games may be games, but they are no trifling matter commercially. Global annual revenues of the board game market have been forecast to hit $13 billion in 2026. And board games have actually gotten more popular in the digital age. Most come from Europe, with many, including “Puerto Rico,” being designed in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many board games are also a source of fond memories for people, going back to childhood — which can make it hard for us to think analytically about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These games are made to be played by families, so it’s something your parents bring you into, [and you think] there couldn’t possibly be anything wrong,” Jakobsson says. “We let our guard down when we play, and stop thinking critically or analytically about content.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jakobsson and Flanagan detail in the book, a huge number of board games glorify colonial domination. Consider a map-based board game Jakobsson played as a child in Sweden, called “African Star,” first made in 1949. In it, players go hunting for a huge diamond in Africa to bring back “to safety” in Europe, while one location on the board is casually called “Slavkusten” — the slave coast. Frivolous as games seem, they can reinforce prejudices about non-Westerners, while never depicting the actual violence of colonial domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s typical of these games that they don’t show [what has been called] the bloody end of the sword,” says Jakobsson, who with Flanagan has collected over 1,000 board games. “That has been sanitized away. But they do show the exploration, expansion, and exploitation of colonialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We could be heroes, just for one game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while “African Star” and other games date to colonial times, empire-building remains a common focus of board games. After “Puerto Rico” reached the market, it was followed by a numerous related colonialist board games, including “Goa” (2004), “Macao” (2009), “Mombasa” (2015), and “Maracaibo” (2019), among others — all games where players aim to exploit particular non-European resources and territory. Other, more geographically expansive games like “Empires: Age of Discovery” (2015), give players the role of a colonizing country, attempting to gain territory and power until winning the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, it might seem that the task of designing a game lends itself to themes of domination and power. There must be some sort of competitive mechanism at work, after all. However, Jakobsson suggests, that does not mean games must reinforce caricatures about Africans or Asians, or blandly glorify what was actually the violent subjugation of other peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Conflict is so common in games that we sometimes see it as being part of the definition of what games are,” Jakobsson acknowledges. “There has to be a struggle, or we start wondering if it’s even a game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he adds, “The more complex argument we’re making in the book, and I have to give Mary a lot of credit for digging deep into the history of games, is that games have always been a way for those in power to try to put themselves in the role of heroes. And they’ve always been used as propaganda. When we start thinking the way these games work is simply how it has to be, we’re ignoring a very long history of using certain game mechanics as a potent tool of messaging for whoever is in control. It’s just something we taught ourselves to think is a natural format for competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in motion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other scholars in the field have praised “Playing Oppression.” Tracy Fullerton, the director of the University of Southern California’s Game Innovation Lab, calls the book a “rigorous exploration of colonialist themes and mechanics in historical and modern board games that contains fascinating new exemplars, unflinching discussions of modern favorites, and a hopeful sighting of a way to go beyond insidious colonialist tropes in innovative designs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As “Playing Oppression” also makes clear, the themes of board games reflect the interests of those who play them. Scores of board games have represented the colonial project because, at one time, those who benefited from colonialism were playing the games. Today, though, that is changing. More games are being designed in East Asia, South Asia, and the Global South; creators around the world, Jakobsson notes, are looking for new approaches to their classic occupation. That includes game designers in the U.S. and Europe, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Board games used to be the rich people’s pastime,” Jakobsson says. “It was very expensive to make games, and they were hand-painted. It wasn’t something the masses would engage in. They did play other games. But this was a way of expressing abundance [material wealth]. That’s not true any more. We’re starting to see board game design and playing communities growing all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts in board game design are even reflected in the fact that “Puerto Rico” has been rebranded, as of 2022, as “Puerto Rico 1897,” with changes to lift the game out of the colonial era. Over time, Jakobsson suggests, as a wider variety of people make games, a wider variety of games will gain mainstream popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t necessarily tied to always telling stories of conquest and domination,” Jakobsson says. “That is how [many of us] have interpreted history. But a lot of people’s cultural experience is one of resistance and struggle. It’s not that everything in game design is going to be about planting flowers, exactly, but I think we’re seeing a broader spectrum of perspectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>New African and African diaspora studies major takes off at MIT</title>

        <dc:creator>Pranav Menon | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Commencement 2022 marked a milestone in MIT’s history, as Stacy Godfreey-Igwe ’22 became the first student to graduate in &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/undergraduate/interdisciplinary/majors/african"&gt;African and African diaspora studies&lt;/a&gt; (AADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godfreey-Igwe also majored in mechanical engineering and is now a fellow at the Science Technology Policy Institute in Washington. She recalls that while she did not initially intend to major in AADS, as the child of Nigerian immigrants she has long had a deep interest in her cultural and ethnic background. This interest, paired with her desire to create a social impact through engineering, led her to forge a new path at MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I originally came to MIT wanting to see if there were ways to do good with engineering,” Godfreey-Igwe reflects. “I found that maybe my way to enter into that would be in part understanding my cultural identity, and seeing what I could do from there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Godfreey-Igwe sought advice from MIT's Danielle Wood about the potential for pursuing a double major with mechanical engineering. Wood, an assistant professor of media arts and sciences and of aeronautics and astronautics, had recently begun serving as the faculty advisor for African and African diaspora studies at MIT. When Godfreey-Igwe made the request, a formal major in AADS did not yet exist, although the minor and concentration were available. Wood helped Godfreey-Igwe complete a petition for a customized major in&amp;nbsp;MIT’s &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS). Inspired by Godfreey-Igwe’s request, Wood formally applied through SHASS to receive Institute approval to officially offer the major in AADS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The request was approved in 2021, and MIT undergraduates now have the option to pursue a major, minor, or concentration in AADS. The program also collaborates with the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt;) to offer opportunities for students to gain credit toward AADS while studying abroad at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, approximately 15 MIT undergraduates are pursuing a concentration, minor, or major in AADS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood says the major builds upon the foundation of the preexisting minor and concentration, the framework provided by other interdisciplinary majors, and the intellectual and pedagogical efforts of generations of scholars at MIT, including professors Michel DeGraff, Helen Elaine Lee, D. Fox Harrell, Kenneth Manning, Craig Steven Wilder, and Melissa Nobles. Wood took over as AADS faculty advisor after collaborating with Harrell (previous AADS faculty advisor) and DeGraff to co-instruct the gateway course for the major, 24.912 (&lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-912-black-matters-introduction-to-black-studies-spring-2017/" target="_blank"&gt;Black Matters: Introduction to Black Studies&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was a long history of people before me who were involved with making this opportunity,” Wood says. “The AADS major thus represents a coming together of threads from across MIT’s schools and departments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AADS major, minor, and concentration curriculum combines a broad exposure to the disciplines of history, arts, social science, and the humanities with opportunities to study comparatively across global contexts. Beyond the introductory subject and fourth-year thesis, the major requires training in a language relevant to people of Africa and its diasporas (including over 30 Indigenous African languages such as Igbo, Amharic, and Luganda, as well as Haitian Creole, French, Spanish, and Portuguese). In addition to language training, students complete elective subjects that span humanities, arts, social sciences, and history. They also complete a thesis on a topic of their choosing; Godfreey-Igwe, for example, used her thesis to study mass migrations from West Africa to Europe with Amah Edoh, a former faculty member in MIT’s Department of Anthropology. The findings of Godfreey-Igwe’s thesis coded interviews with migrants from West Africa to challenge traditional assumptions about motivations for migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The African and African diaspora studies major invites students from all backgrounds to explore the riches of culture, innovation, thought leadership, and beauty that originate in the continent of Africa and its many diasporas. The major also celebrates opportunities for students such as Godfreey-Igwe, whose identity includes African heritage, to enter a personal journey of self-discovery. The presence of the major adds to the well-rounded list of interdisciplinary offerings, including opportunities to learn about Latinx, Asian, American, Eurasia, and Medieval studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood says she's grateful to all the teams at MIT that made it possible to officially start the AADS major, adding she hopes it lays a foundation for the addition of further perspectives, such as Indigenous studies. She notes that Andrea Wirth, an academic administrator at MIT who passed away in 2022, was instrumental in establishing the AADS major concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The addition of the AADS major highlights an example of an institutional change that can tangibly contribute to living out the &lt;a href="https://www.mit.edu/values"&gt;MIT Values&lt;/a&gt; of belonging and community, excellence and curiosity, openness and respect,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1994, as Professor Peter Shor PhD ’85 tells it, internal seminars at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs were lively affairs. The audience of physicists was an active and inquisitive bunch, often pelting speakers with questions throughout their talks. Shor, who worked at Bell Labs at the time, remembers several occasions when a speaker couldn’t get past their third slide, as they attempted to address a rapid line of questioning before their time was up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year, when Shor took his turn to present an algorithm he had recently worked out, the physicists paid keen attention to Shor’s entire talk — and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mine went pretty well,” he told an MIT audience yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that 1994 seminar talk, Shor presented a proof that showed how a quantum system could be applied to solve a particular problem more quickly than a classical computer. That problem, known as the discrete logarithm problem, was known to be unsolvable by classical means. As such, discrete logarithms had been used as the basis for a handful of security systems at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shor’s work was the first to show that a quantum computer could solve a real, practical problem. His talk set the seminar abuzz, and the news spread, then became conflated. Four days after his initial talk, physicists across the country were assuming Shor had solved a related, though much thornier problem: prime factorization — the challenge of finding a very large number’s two prime factors. Though some security systems employ discrete logarithms, most encryption schemes today are based on prime factorization and the assumption that it is impossible to crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“It was like the children’s game of ‘telephone,’ where the rumor spread that I had figured out factoring,” Shor says. “And in the four days since [the talk], I had!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By tweaking his original problem, Shor happened to find a similar quantum solution for prime factorization. His solution, known today as Shor’s algorithm, showed how a quantum computer could factorize very large numbers. Quantum computing, once thought of as a thought experiment, suddenly had in Shor’s algorithm an instruction manual for a very real, and potentially disruptive application. His work simultaneously ignited multiple new lines of research in quantum computing, information science, and cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is history, the highlights of which Shor recounted to a standing-room-only audience in MIT’s Huntington Hall, Room 10-250. Shor, who is the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT, spoke as this year’s recipient of the James R. Killian, Jr. Faculty Achievement Award, which is the highest honor the Institute faculty can bestow upon one of its members each academic year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In introducing Shor’s talk, Lily Tsai, chair of the faculty, quoted the award citation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without exception, the faculty who nominated him all commented on his vision, genius, and technical mastery, and commended him for the brilliance of his work,” Tsai said. “Professor Shor’s work demonstrates that quantum computers have the potential to open up new avenues of human thought and endeavor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A quantum history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the one-hour lecture, Shor took the audience through a brief history of quantum computing, peppering the talk with personal recollections of his own role. The story, he said, begins in the 1930s with the discovery of quantum mechanics — the physical behavior of matter at the smallest, subatomic scales — and the question that soon followed: Why was quantum so strange?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physicists grappled with the new description of the physical world, which was so different from the “classical” Newtonian mechanics that had been understood for centuries. Shor says that the physicist Erwin Schrödinger attempted to “illustrate the absurdity” of the new theory with his now-famous thought experiment involving a cat in a box: How can it embody both states — dead and alive? The exercise challenged the idea of superposition, a key property of quantum mechanics that predicts a quantum bit such as an atom should hold more than one state simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spookier still was the prediction of entanglement, which posed that two atoms could be inextricably linked. Any change to one should then affect the other, no matter the distance separating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nobody considered using this strangeness for information storage, until Wiesner,” Shor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wiesner was Stephen Wiesner, who in the late 1960s was a graduate student at Columbia University who was later credited with formulating some of the basic principles of quantum information theory. Wiesner’s key contribution was a paper that was initially spurned. He had proposed a way to create “quantum money,” or currency that was resistant to forgery, by harnessing a strange property in which quantum states cannot be perfectly duplicated — a prediction known as the “no-cloning” theorem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Shor remembers it, Wiesner wrote out his idea on a typewriter, sent it off for consideration by his peers, and was roundly rejected. It wasn’t until another physicist, Charles Bennett, found the paper, “pulled it out of a drawer, and got it published,” solidifying Wiesner’s role in quantum computing’s history. Bennett went further, realizing that the basic idea of quantum money could be applied to develop a scheme of quantum key distribution, in which the security of a piece of information, such as a private key passed between parties, is protected by another weird quantum property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bennett worked out the idea with Gilles Brassard in 1984. The BB84 algorithm was the first protocol for a crypto system that relied entirely on the weird phenomena of quantum physics. Sometime in the 1980s, Bennett came around to Bell Labs to present BB84. It was Shor’s first time hearing of quantum computing, and he was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shor initially tried to work out an answer to a question Bennett posed to the audience: How can the protocol be proven mathematically to indeed be secure? The problem, however, was too thorny, and Shor abandoned the question, though not the subject. He followed the efforts of his colleagues in the growing field of quantum information science, eventually landing on a paper by physicist Daniel Simon, who proposed something truly weird: that a system of quantum computing bits could solve a particular problem exponentially faster than a classical computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem itself, as Simon posed it, was an esoteric one, and his paper, like Wiesner’s, was initially rejected. But Shor saw something in its structure — specifically, that the problem related to the much more concrete problems of discrete logarithms and factoring. He worked from Simon’s starting point to see whether a quantum system could solve discrete logarithms more quickly than a classical system. His first attempts were a draw. The quantum algorithm solved a problem just as fast as its classical counterpart. But there were hints that it could do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s still hope in trying,” Shor remembers thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he did work it out, he presented his algorithm for a quantum discrete log algorithm in the 1994 symposium at Bell Labs. In the four days since his talk, he managed to also work out his eponymous prime factorization algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception was overwhelming but also skeptical, as physicists assumed that a practical quantum computer would instantly crumble at the barest hint of noise, resulting in a cascade of errors in its factoring computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I worried about this problem,” Shor said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, he again went to work, looking for a way to correct errors in a quantum system without disturbing the state of the computing quantum bits. He found an answer through concatenation, which broadly refers to a series of interconnected events. In his case, Shor found a way to link qubits, and store the information of one logical, or computing qubit among nine highly entangled, physical qubits. In this way, any error in the logical qubit can be measured and fixed within the physical qubits, without having to measure (and therefore destroy) the qubit involved in the actual computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shor’s new algorithm was the first quantum error correcting code that proved a quantum computer could be tolerant to faults, and therefore a very real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The world of quantum mechanics is not the world of your intuition,” Shor said in closing his remarks. “Quantum mechanics is the way the world really is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum’s future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following his talk, Shor took several questions from the audience, including one that drives a huge effort in quantum information science today: When will we see a real, practical quantum computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To factor a large number, Shor estimates that a quantum system would require at least 1,000 qubits. To factor the very large numbers that underpin today’s internet and security systems would require millions of qubits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s going to take a whole bunch of years,” Shor said. “We may never make a quantum computer, ever… but if someone has a great idea, maybe we could see one 10 years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, he noted that, as work in quantum computing has ballooned in recent years, so has work toward post-quantum cryptography and efforts to develop alternative crypto systems &amp;nbsp;that are secure against quantum-based code cracking. Shor compares these efforts to the scramble leading up to “Y2K,” and the prospect of a digital catastrophe at the turn of the last century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You probably should have started years ago,” Shor said. “If you wait until the last minute, when it’s clear quantum computers will be built, you will probably be too late.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shor received his PhD from MIT in 1985, and went on to complete a postdoc at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at Berkeley, California. He then spent several years at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs, and then at AT&amp;amp;T Shannon Labs, before returning to MIT as a tenured faculty member in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shor’s contributions have been recognized by numerous awards, most recently with the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, which he shared with Bennett, Brassard, and physicist David Deutsch. His other accolades include the MacArthur Fellowship, the Nevanlinna Prize (now the IMU Abacus Medal), the Dirac Medal, the King Faisal International Prize in Science, and the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award. Shor is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is also a fellow of the American Mathematical Society and the Association for Computing Machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
