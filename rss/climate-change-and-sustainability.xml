  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new MIT-led study confirms that the Antarctic ozone layer is healing, as a direct result of global efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists including the MIT team have observed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/signs-healing-antarctic-ozone-layer-0630" target="_blank"&gt;signs of ozone recovery&lt;/a&gt; in the past. But the new study is the first to show, with high statistical confidence, that this recovery is due primarily to the reduction of ozone-depleting substances, versus other influences such as natural weather variability or increased greenhouse gas emissions to the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been a lot of qualitative evidence showing that the Antarctic ozone hole is getting better. This is really the first study that has quantified confidence in the recovery of the ozone hole,” says study author Susan Solomon, the Lee and Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies and Chemistry. “The conclusion is, with 95 percent confidence, it is recovering. Which is awesome. And it shows we can actually solve environmental problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08640-9" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Graduate student Peidong Wang from the Solomon group in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) is the lead author. His co-authors include Solomon and EAPS Research Scientist Kane Stone, along with collaborators from multiple other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roots of ozone recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the Earth’s stratosphere, ozone is a naturally occurring gas that acts as a sort of sunscreen, protecting the planet from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. In 1985, scientists discovered a “hole” in the ozone layer over Antarctica that opened up during the austral spring, between September and December. This seasonal ozone depletion was suddenly allowing UV rays to filter down to the surface, leading to skin cancer and other adverse health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Solomon, who was then working at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), led expeditions to the Antarctic, where she and her colleagues gathered evidence that quickly confirmed the ozone hole’s cause: chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs — chemicals that were then used in refrigeration, air conditioning, insulation, and aerosol propellants. When CFCs drift up into the stratosphere, they can break down ozone under certain seasonal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year, those relevations led to the drafting of the Montreal Protocol — an international treaty that aimed to phase out the production of CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, in hopes of healing the ozone hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Solomon led a study reporting key signs of ozone recovery. The ozone hole seemed to be shrinking with each year, especially in September, the time of year when it opens up. Still, these observations were qualitative. The study showed large uncertainties regarding how much of this recovery was due to concerted efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances, or if the shrinking ozone hole was a result of other “forcings,” such as year-to-year weather variability from El Niño, La Niña, and the polar vortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While detecting a statistically significant increase in ozone is relatively straightforward, attributing these changes to specific forcings is more challenging,” says Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthropogenic healing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the MIT team took a quantitative approach to identify the cause of Antarctic ozone recovery. The researchers borrowed a method from the climate change community, known as “fingerprinting,” which was pioneered by Klaus Hasselmann, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2021 for the technique. In the context of climate, fingerprinting refers to a method that isolates the influence of specific climate factors, apart from natural, meteorological noise. Hasselmann applied fingerprinting to identify, confirm, and quantify the anthropogenic fingerprint of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon and Wang looked to apply the fingerprinting method to identify another anthropogenic signal: the effect of human reductions in ozone-depleting substances on the recovery of the ozone hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The atmosphere has really chaotic variability within it,” Solomon says. “What we’re trying to detect is the emerging signal of ozone recovery against that kind of variability, which also occurs in the stratosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers started with simulations of the Earth’s atmosphere and generated multiple “parallel worlds,” or simulations of the same global atmosphere, under different starting conditions. For instance, they ran simulations under conditions that assumed no increase in greenhouse gases or ozone-depleting substances. Under these conditions, any changes in ozone should be the result of natural weather variability. They also ran simulations with only increasing greenhouse gases, as well as only decreasing ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared these simulations to observe how ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere changed, both with season, and across different altitudes, in response to different starting conditions. From these simulations, they mapped out the times and altitudes where ozone recovered from month to month, over several decades, and identified a key “fingerprint,” or pattern, of ozone recovery that was specifically due to conditions of declining ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then looked for this fingerprint in actual satellite observations of the Antarctic ozone hole from 2005 to the present day. They found that, over time, the fingerprint that they identified in simulations became clearer and clearer in observations. In 2018, the fingerprint was at its strongest, and the team could say with 95 percent confidence that ozone recovery was due mainly to reductions in ozone-depleting substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After 15 years of observational records, we see this signal to noise with 95 percent confidence, suggesting there’s only a very small chance that the observed pattern similarity can be explained by variability noise,” Wang says. “This gives us confidence in the fingerprint. It also gives us confidence&amp;nbsp;that we can solve environmental problems. What we can learn from ozone studies is how different countries can swiftly follow these treaties to decrease emissions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trend continues, and the fingerprint of ozone recovery grows stronger, Solomon anticipates that soon there will be a year, here and there, when the ozone layer stays entirely intact. And eventually, the ozone hole should stay shut for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By something like 2035, we might see a year when there’s no ozone hole depletion at all in the Antarctic. And that will be very exciting for me,” she says. “And some of you will see the ozone hole go away completely in your lifetimes. And people did that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation and NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Zoe Fisher was in fourth grade, her art teacher asked her to draw her vision of a dream job on paper. At the time, those goals changed like the flavor of the week in an ice cream shop — “zookeeper” featured prominently for a while — but Zoe immediately knew what she wanted to put down: a mad scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Fisher stumbled upon the drawing in her parents’ Chicago home recently, it felt serendipitous because, by all measures, she has realized that childhood dream. The second-year doctoral student at MIT's Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE) is studying materials for fusion power plants at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC) under the advisement of &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/short.html"&gt;Michael Short&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at NSE. &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/whyte.html"&gt;Dennis Whyte&lt;/a&gt;, Hitachi America Professor of Engineering at NSE, serves as co-advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On track to an MIT education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Chicago, Fisher had heard her parents remarking on her reasoning abilities. When she was barely a preschooler she argued that she couldn’t have been found in a purple speckled egg, as her parents claimed they had done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher didn’t put together just how much she had gravitated toward science until a high school physics teacher encouraged her to apply to MIT. Passionate about both the arts and sciences, she initially worried that pursuing science would be very rigid, without room for creativity. But she knows now that exploring solutions to problems requires plenty of creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a visit to MIT through the Weekend Immersion in Science and Engineering (&lt;a href="https://mitadmissions.org/pages/wise/" target="_blank"&gt;WISE&lt;/a&gt;) that truly opened her eyes to the&amp;nbsp;potential of an MIT education. “It just seemed like the undergraduate experience here is where you can be very unapologetically yourself. There’s no fronting something you don’t want to be like. There’s so much authenticity compared to most other colleges I looked at,” Fisher says. Once admitted, Campus Preview Weekend confirmed that she belonged. “We got to be silly and weird — a version of the Mafia game was a hit — and I was like, ‘These are my people,’” Fisher laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursuing fusion at NSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she officially started as a first-year in 2018, Fisher enrolled in the Freshman Pre-Orientation Program (FPOP), which starts a week before orientation starts. Each FPOP zooms into one field. “I’d applied to the nuclear one simply because it sounded cool and I didn’t know anything about it,” Fisher says. She was intrigued right away. “They really got me with that ‘&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdoI1X5m96s" target="_blank"&gt;star in a bottle&lt;/a&gt;’ line,” she laughs. (The quest for commercial fusion is to create the energy equivalent of a star in a bottle). Excited by a talk by &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/nse/people/faculty/hartwig.html"&gt;Zachary Hartwig&lt;/a&gt;, Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor at NSE, Fisher asked if she could work on fusion as an undergraduate as part of an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (&lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;UROP&lt;/a&gt;) project. She started with modeling solders for power plants and was hooked. When Fisher requested more experimental work, Hartwig put her in touch with Research Scientist &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/pushing-envelope-fusion-magnets-david-fischer-1106" target="_blank"&gt;David Fischer&lt;/a&gt; at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). Fisher eventually moved on to explore superconductors, which eventually morphed into research for her master’s thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her doctoral research, Fisher is extending her master’s work to explore defects in ceramics, specifically in alumina (aluminum oxide). Sapphire coatings are the single-crystal equivalent of alumina, an insulator being explored for use in fusion power plants. “I eventually want to figure out what types of charge defects form in ceramics during radiation damage so we can ultimately engineer radiation-resistant sapphire,” Fisher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you introduce a material in a fusion power plant, stray high-energy neutrons born from the plasma can collide and fundamentally reorder the lattice, which is likely to change a range of thermal, electrical, and structural properties. “Think of a scaffolding outside a building, with each one of those joints as a different atom that holds your material in place. If you go in and you pull a joint out, there’s a chance that you pulled out a joint that wasn’t structurally sound, in which case everything would be fine. But there’s also a chance that you pull a joint out and everything alters. And [such unpredictability] is a problem,” Fisher says. “We need to be able to account for exactly how these neutrons are going to alter the lattice property,” Fisher says, and it’s one of the topics her research explores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies, in turn, can function as a jumping-off point for irradiating superconductors. The goals are two-fold: “I want to figure out how I can make an industry-usable ceramic you can use to insulate the inside of a fusion power plant, and then also figure out if I can take this information that I’m getting with ceramics and make it superconductor-relevant,” Fisher says. “Superconductors are the electromagnets we will use to contain the plasma inside fusion power plants. However, they prove pretty difficult to study. Since they are also ceramic, you can draw a lot of parallels between alumina and yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), the specific superconductor we use,” she adds. Fisher is also excited about the many experiments she performs using a particle accelerator, one of which involves measuring exactly how surface thermal properties change during radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sailing new paths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just her research that Fisher loves. As an undergrad, and during her master’s, she was on the varsity sailing team. “I worked my way into sailing with literal Olympians, I did not see that coming,” she says. Fisher participates in Chicago’s &lt;a href="https://cycracetomackinac.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Race to Mackinac&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.melges15.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Melges 15 Series &lt;/a&gt;every chance she gets. Of all the types of boats she has sailed, she prefers dinghy sailing the most. “It’s more physical, you have to throw yourself around a lot and there’s this immediate cause and effect, which I like,” Fisher says. She also teaches sailing lessons in the summer at &lt;a href="https://sailing.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT’s Sailing Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; — you can find her on a small motorboat, issuing orders through a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching has figured prominently throughout Fisher’s time at MIT. Through &lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt;, Fisher has taught high school classes in Germany and a radiation and materials class in Armenia in her senior year. She was delighted by the food and culture in Armenia and by how excited people were to learn new ideas. Her love of teaching continues, as she has reached out to high schools in the Boston area. “I like talking to groups and getting them excited about fusion, or even maybe just the concept of attending graduate school,” Fisher says, adding that teaching the ropes of an experiment one-on-one is “one of the most rewarding things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also learned the value of resilience and quick thinking on various other MISTI trips. Despite her love of travel, Fisher has had a few harrowing experiences with tough situations and plans falling through at the last minute. It’s when she tells herself, “Well, the only thing that you’re gonna do is you’re gonna keep doing what you wanted to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That eyes-on-the-prize focus has stood Fisher in good stead, and continues to serve her well in her research today.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Will neutrons compromise the operation of superconducting magnets in a fusion plant?</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-temperature superconducting magnets made from REBCO, an acronym for rare earth barium copper oxide, make it possible to create an intense magnetic field that can confine the extremely hot plasma needed for fusion reactions, which combine two hydrogen atoms to form an atom of helium, releasing a neutron in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some early tests suggested that neutron irradiation inside a fusion power plant might instantaneously suppress the superconducting magnets’ ability to carry current without resistance (called critical current), potentially causing a reduction in the fusion power output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a series of experiments has clearly demonstrated that this instantaneous effect of neutron bombardment, known as the “beam on effect,” should not be an issue during reactor operation, thus clearing the path for projects such as the ARC fusion system being developed by MIT spinoff company Commonwealth Fusion Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/ad95c2" target="_blank"&gt;reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Superconducting Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by MIT graduate student Alexis Devitre and professors Michael Short, Dennis Whyte, and Zachary Hartwig, along with six others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really knew if it would be a concern,” Short explains. He recalls looking at these early findings: “Our group thought, man, somebody should really look into this. But now, luckily, the result of the paper is: It’s conclusively not a concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possible issue first arose during some initial tests of the REBCO tapes planned for use in the ARC system. “I can remember the night when we first tried the experiment,” Devitre recalls. “We were all down in the accelerator lab, in the basement. It was a big shocker because suddenly the measurement we were looking at, the critical current, just went down by 30 percent” when it was measured under radiation conditions (approximating those of the fusion system), as opposed to when it was only measured after irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, researchers had irradiated the REBCO tapes and then tested them afterward, Short says. “We had the idea to measure while irradiating, the way it would be when the reactor’s really on,” he says. “And then we observed this giant difference, and we thought, oh, this is a big deal. It’s a margin you’d want to know about if you’re designing a reactor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a series of carefully calibrated tests, it turned out the drop in critical current was not caused by the irradiation at all, but was just an effect of temperature changes brought on by the proton beam used for the irradiation experiments. This is something that would not be a factor in an actual fusion plant, Short says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We repeated experiments ‘oh so many times’ and collected about a thousand data points,” Devitre says. They then went through a detailed statistical analysis to show that the effects were exactly the same, under conditions where the material was just heated as when it was both heated and irradiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This excluded the possibility that the instantaneous suppression of the critical current had anything to do with the “beam on effect,” at least within the sensitivity of their tests. “Our experiments are quite sensitive,” Short says. “We can never say there’s no effect, but we can say that there’s no important effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out these tests required building a special facility for the purpose. Only a few such facilities exist in the world. “They’re all custom builds, and without this, we wouldn’t have been able to find out the answer,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that this specific issue is not a concern for the design of fusion plants “illustrates the power of negative results. If you can conclusively prove that something doesn’t happen, you can stop scientists from wasting their time hunting for something that doesn’t exist.” And in this case, Short says, “You can tell the fusion companies: ‘You might have thought this effect would be real, but we’ve proven that it’s not, and you can ignore it in your designs.’ So that’s one more risk retired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could be a relief to not only Commonwealth Fusion Systems but also several other companies that are also pursuing fusion plant designs, Devitre says. “There’s a bunch. And it’s not just fusion companies,” he adds. There remains the important issue of longer-term degradation of the REBCO that would occur over years or decades, which the group is presently investigating. Others are pursuing the use of these magnets for satellite thrusters and particle accelerators to study subatomic physics, where the effect could also have been a concern. For all these uses, “this is now one less thing to be concerned about,” Devitre says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also included David Fischer, Kevin Woller, Maxwell Rae, Lauryn Kortman, and Zoe Fisher at MIT, and N. Riva at Proxima Fusion in Germany.&amp;nbsp;This research was supported by Eni S.p.A. through the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As part of a multi-pronged approach toward curbing the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, scientists seek to better understand the impact of rising carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly tropical forests. To that end, climate scientist César Terrer, the Class of 1958 Career Development Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at MIT, and colleague Josh Fisher of Chapman University are bringing their scientific minds to bear on a unique setting —&amp;nbsp;an active volcano in Costa Rica — as a way to study carbon dioxide emissions and their influence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels can lead to a phenomenon known as the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fertilization effect, where plants grow more and absorb greater amounts of carbon, providing a cooling effect. While this effect has the potential to be a natural climate change mitigator, the extent of how much carbon plants can continue to absorb remains uncertain. There are growing concerns from scientists that plants may eventually reach a saturation point, losing their ability to offset increasing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for accurate climate predictions and developing strategies to manage carbon sequestration. Here, Terrer discusses his innovative approach, his motivations for joining the project, and the importance of advancing this research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why did you get involved in this line of research, and what makes it unique?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Josh Fisher, a climate scientist and long-time collaborator, had the brilliant idea to take advantage of naturally high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels near active volcanoes to study the fertilization effect in real-world conditions. Conducting such research in dense tropical forests like the Amazon — where the largest uncertainties about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fertilization exist — is challenging. It would require large-scale CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tanks and extensive infrastructure to evenly distribute the gas throughout the towering trees and intricate canopy layers — a task that is not only logistically complex, but also highly costly. Our approach allows us to circumvent those obstacles and gather critical data in a way that hasn't been done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh was looking for an expert in the field of carbon ecology to co-lead and advance this research with him.&amp;nbsp;My expertise of understanding the dynamics that regulate carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems within the context of climate change made for a natural fit to co-lead and advance this research with him. This field has been central to my research, and was the focus of my PhD thesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experiments inside the Rincon de la Vieja National Park are particularly exciting because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations&amp;nbsp;in the areas near the volcano are four times higher than the global average. This gives us a rare opportunity to observe how elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affects plant biomass in a natural setting — something that has never been attempted at this scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How are you measuring CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations at the volcano?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We have installed a network of 50 sensors in the forest canopy surrounding the volcano. These sensors continuously monitor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, allowing us to compare areas with naturally high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from the volcano to control areas with typical atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. The sensors are Bluetooth-enabled, requiring us to be in close proximity to retrieve the data. They will remain in place for a full year, capturing a continuous dataset on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations. Our next data collection trip is scheduled for March, with another planned a year after the initial deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are the long-term goals of this research?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Our primary objective is to determine whether the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fertilization effect can be sustained, or if plants will eventually reach a saturation point, limiting their ability to absorb additional carbon. Understanding this threshold is crucial for improving climate models and carbon mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To expand the scope of our measurements, we are exploring the use of airborne technologies — such as drones or airplane-mounted sensors — to assess carbon storage across larger areas. This would provide a more comprehensive view of carbon sequestration potential in tropical ecosystems. Ultimately, this research could offer critical insights into the future role of forests in mitigating climate change, helping scientists and policymakers develop more accurate carbon budgets and climate projections. If successful, our approach could pave the way for similar studies in other ecosystems, deepening our understanding of how nature responds to rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of untapped potential in our homes and vehicles that could be harnessed to reinforce local power grids and make them more resilient to unforeseen outages, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a cyber attack or natural disaster, a backup network of decentralized devices — such as residential solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and water heaters — could restore electricity or relieve stress on the grid, MIT engineers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such devices are “grid-edge” resources found close to the consumer rather than near central power plants, substations, or transmission lines. Grid-edge devices can independently generate, store, or tune their consumption of power. In their study, the research team shows how such devices could one day be called upon to either pump power into the grid, or rebalance it by dialing down or delaying their power use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413967121" target="_blank"&gt;appearing this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the engineers present a blueprint for how grid-edge devices could reinforce the power grid through a “&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9774996" target="_blank"&gt;local electricity market&lt;/a&gt;.” Owners of grid-edge devices could subscribe to a regional market and essentially loan out their device to be part of a microgrid or a local network of on-call energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that the main power grid is compromised, an algorithm developed by the researchers would kick in for each local electricity market, to quickly determine which devices in the network are trustworthy. The algorithm would then identify the combination of trustworthy devices that would most effectively mitigate the power failure, by either pumping power into the grid or reducing the power they draw from it, by an amount that the algorithm would calculate and communicate to the relevant subscribers. The subscribers could then be compensated through the market, depending on their participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team illustrated this new framework through a number of grid attack scenarios, in which they considered failures at different levels of a power grid, from various sources such as a cyber attack or a natural disaster. Applying their algorithm, they showed that various networks of grid-edge devices were able to dissolve the various attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate that grid-edge devices such as rooftop solar panels, EV chargers, batteries, and smart thermostats (for HVAC devices or heat pumps) could be tapped to stabilize the power grid in the event of an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these small devices can do their little bit in terms of adjusting their consumption,” says study co-author Anu Annaswamy, a research scientist in MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. “If we can harness our smart dishwashers, rooftop panels, and EVs, and put our combined shoulders to the wheel, we can really have a resilient grid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include lead author Vineet Nair and John Williams, along with collaborators from multiple institutions including the Indian Institute of Technology, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power boost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s study is an extension of their broader work in adaptive control theory and designing systems to automatically adapt to changing conditions. Annaswamy, who leads the Active-Adaptive Control Laboratory at MIT, explores ways to boost the reliability of renewable energy sources such as solar power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These renewables come with a strong temporal signature, in that we know for sure the sun will set every day, so the solar power will go away,” Annaswamy says. “How do you make up for the shortfall?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the answer could lie in the many grid-edge devices that consumers are increasingly installing in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are lots of distributed energy resources that are coming up now, closer to the customer rather than near large power plants, and it’s mainly because of individual efforts to decarbonize,” Nair says. “So you have all this capability at the grid edge. Surely we should be able to put them to good use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While considering ways to deal with drops in energy from the normal operation of renewable sources, the team also began to look into other causes of power dips, such as from cyber attacks. They wondered, in these malicious instances, whether and how the same grid-edge devices could step in to stabilize the grid following an unforeseen, targeted attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new work, Annaswamy, Nair, and their colleagues developed a framework for incorporating grid-edge devices, and in particular, internet-of-things (IoT) devices, in a way that would support the larger grid in the event of an attack or disruption. IoT devices are physical objects that contain sensors and software that connect to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their new framework, named EUREICA (Efficient, Ultra-REsilient, IoT-Coordinated Assets), the researchers start with the assumption that one day, most grid-edge devices will also be IoT devices, enabling rooftop panels, EV chargers, and smart thermostats to wirelessly connect to a larger network of similarly independent and distributed devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team envisions that for a given region, such as a community of 1,000 homes, there exists a certain number of IoT devices that could potentially be enlisted in the region’s local network, or microgrid. Such a network would be managed by an operator, who would be able to communicate with operators of other nearby microgrids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the main power grid is compromised or attacked, operators would run the researchers’ decision-making algorithm to determine trustworthy devices within the network that can pitch in to help mitigate the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested the algorithm on a number of scenarios, such as a cyber attack in which all smart thermostats made by a certain manufacturer are hacked to raise their setpoints simultaneously to a degree that dramatically alters a region’s energy load and destabilizes the grid. The researchers also considered attacks and weather events that would shut off the transmission of energy at various levels and nodes throughout a power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our attacks we consider between 5 and 40 percent of the power being lost. We assume some nodes are attacked, and some are still available and have some IoT resources, whether a battery with energy available or an EV or HVAC device that’s controllable,” Nair explains. “So, our algorithm decides which of those houses can step in to either provide extra power generation to inject into the grid or reduce their demand to meet the shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every scenario that they tested, the team found that the algorithm was able to successfully restabilize the grid and mitigate the attack or power failure. They acknowledge that to put in place such a network of grid-edge devices will require buy-in from customers, policymakers, and local officials, as well as innovations such as advanced power inverters that enable EVs to inject power back into the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is just the first of many steps that have to happen in quick succession for this idea of local electricity markets to be implemented and expanded upon,” Annaswamy says. “But we believe it’s a good start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy and the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Reducing carbon emissions from residential heating: A pathway forward</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the race to reduce climate-warming carbon emissions, the buildings sector is falling behind. While carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions in the U.S. electric power sector dropped by 34 percent between 2005 and 2021, emissions in the building sector declined by only 18 percent in that same time period. Moreover, in extremely cold locations, burning natural gas to heat houses can make up a substantial share of the emissions portfolio. Therefore, steps to electrify buildings in general, and residential heating in particular, are essential for decarbonizing the U.S. energy system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that change will increase demand for electricity and decrease demand for natural gas. What will be the net impact of those two changes on carbon emissions and on the cost of decarbonizing? And how will the electric power and natural gas sectors handle the new challenges involved in their long-term planning for future operations and infrastructure investments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by MIT researchers with support from the &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (MITEI) &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/futureenergysystemscenter/"&gt;Future Energy Systems Center&lt;/a&gt; unravels the impacts of various levels of electrification of residential space heating on the joint power and natural gas systems. A specially devised modeling framework enabled them to estimate not only the added costs and emissions for the power sector to meet the new demand, but also any changes in costs and emissions that result for the natural gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses brought some surprising outcomes. For example, they show that — under certain conditions — switching 80 percent of homes to heating by electricity could cut carbon emissions and at the same time significantly reduce costs over the combined natural gas and electric power sectors relative to the case in which there is only modest switching. That outcome depends on two changes: Consumers must install high-efficiency heat pumps plus take steps to prevent heat losses from their homes, and planners in the power and the natural gas sectors must work together as they make long-term infrastructure and operations decisions. Based on their findings, the researchers stress the need for strong state, regional, and national policies that encourage and support the steps that homeowners and industry planners can take to help decarbonize today’s building sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A two-part modeling approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze the impacts of electrification of residential heating on costs and emissions in the combined power and gas sectors, a team of MIT experts in building technology, power systems modeling, optimization techniques, and more developed a two-part modeling framework. Team members included &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/rahman-khorramfar/"&gt;Rahman Khorramfar&lt;/a&gt;, a senior postdoc in MITEI and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS); &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/morgan-santoni-colvin/"&gt;Morgan Santoni-Colvin&lt;/a&gt; SM ’23, a former MITEI graduate research assistant, now an associate at Energy and Environmental Economics, Inc.; &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/saurabh-amin/"&gt;Saurabh Amin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and principal investigator in LIDS; &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/audun-botterud/"&gt;Audun Botterud&lt;/a&gt;, a principal research scientist in LIDS; &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/leslie-norford/"&gt;Leslie Norford&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Architecture; and &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/profile/dharik-mallapragada/"&gt;Dharik Mallapragada&lt;/a&gt;, a former MITEI principal research scientist, now an assistant professor at New York University, who led the project. They describe their new methods and findings in a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-sustainability/fulltext/S2949-7906(25)00003-5"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Sustainability&lt;/em&gt; on Feb. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first model in the framework quantifies how various levels of electrification will change end-use demand for electricity and for natural gas, and the impacts of possible energy-saving measures that homeowners can take to help. “To perform that analysis, we built a ‘bottom-up’ model — meaning that it looks at electricity and gas consumption of individual buildings and then aggregates their consumption to get an overall demand for power and for gas,” explains&amp;nbsp;Khorramfar. By assuming a wide range of building “archetypes” — that is, groupings of buildings with similar physical characteristics and properties — coupled with trends in population growth, the team could explore how demand for electricity and for natural gas would change under each of five assumed electrification pathways: “business as usual” with modest electrification, medium electrification (about 60 percent of homes are electrified), high electrification (about 80 percent of homes make the change), and medium and high electrification with “envelope improvements,” such as&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;sealing up heat leaks and adding insulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the framework consists of a model that takes the demand results from the first model as inputs and “co-optimizes” the overall electricity and natural gas system to minimize annual investment and operating costs while adhering to any constraints, such as limits on emissions or on resource availability. The modeling framework thus enables the researchers to explore the impact of each electrification pathway on the infrastructure and operating costs of the two interacting sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New England case study: A challenge for electrification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a case study, the researchers chose New England, a region where the weather is sometimes extremely cold and where burning natural gas to heat houses contributes significantly to overall emissions. “Critics will say that electrification is never going to happen [in New England]. It’s just too expensive,” comments Santoni-Colvin. But he notes that most studies focus on the electricity sector in isolation. The new framework considers the joint operation of the two sectors and then quantifies their respective costs and emissions. “We know that electrification will require large investments in the electricity infrastructure,” says Santoni-Colvin. “But what hasn’t been well quantified in the literature is the savings that we generate on the natural gas side by doing that — so, the system-level savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their framework, the MIT team performed model runs aimed at an 80 percent reduction in building-sector emissions relative to 1990 levels — a target consistent with regional policy goals for 2050. The researchers defined parameters including details about building archetypes, the regional electric power system, existing and potential renewable generating systems, battery storage, availability of natural gas, and other key factors describing New England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then performed analyses assuming various scenarios with different mixes of home improvements. While most studies assume typical weather, they instead developed 20 projections of annual weather data based on historical weather patterns and adjusted for the effects of climate change through 2050. They then analyzed their five levels of electrification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to business-as-usual projections, results from the framework showed that high electrification of residential heating could more than double the demand for electricity during peak periods and increase overall electricity demand by close to 60 percent. Assuming that building-envelope improvements are deployed in parallel with electrification reduces the magnitude and weather sensitivity of peak loads and creates overall efficiency gains that reduce the combined demand for electricity plus natural gas for home heating by up to 30 percent relative to the present day. Notably, a combination of high electrification and envelope improvements resulted in the lowest average cost for the overall electric power-natural gas system in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing existing natural gas-burning furnaces and boilers with heat pumps reduces overall energy consumption. Santoni-Colvin calls it “something of an intuitive result” that could be expected because heat pumps are “just that much more efficient than old, fossil fuel-burning systems. But even so, we were surprised by the gains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other unexpected results include the importance of homeowners making more traditional energy efficiency improvements, such as adding insulation and sealing air leaks — steps supported by recent rebate policies. Those changes are critical to reducing costs that would otherwise be incurred for upgrading the electricity grid to accommodate the increased demand. “You can’t just go wild dropping heat pumps into everybody’s houses if you’re not also considering other ways to reduce peak loads. So it really requires an ‘all of the above’ approach to get to the most cost-effective outcome,” says Santoni-Colvin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing a range of weather outcomes also provided important insights. Demand for heating fuel is very weather-dependent, yet most studies are based on a limited set of weather data — often a “typical year.”&amp;nbsp;The researchers found that electrification can lead to extended peak electric load events that can last for a few days during cold winters. Accordingly, the researchers conclude that there will be a continuing need for a “firm, dispatchable” source of electricity; that is, a power-generating system that can be relied on to produce power any time it’s needed — unlike solar and wind systems. As examples, they modeled some possible technologies, including power plants fired by a low-carbon fuel or by natural gas equipped with carbon capture equipment. But they point out that there’s no way of knowing what types of firm generators will be available in 2050. It could be a system that’s not yet mature, or perhaps doesn’t even exist today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In presenting their findings, the researchers note several caveats. For one thing, their analyses don’t include the estimated cost to homeowners of installing heat pumps. While that cost is widely discussed and debated, that issue is outside the scope of their current project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study doesn’t specify what happens to existing natural gas pipelines. “Some homes are going to electrify and get off the gas system and not have to pay for it, leaving other homes with increasing rates because the gas system cost now has to be divided among fewer customers,” says Khorramfar. “That will inevitably raise equity questions that need to be addressed by policymakers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers note that policies are needed to drive residential electrification. Current financial support for installation of heat pumps and steps to make homes more thermally efficient are a good start. But such incentives must be coupled with a new approach to planning energy infrastructure investments. Traditionally, electric power planning and natural gas planning are performed separately. However, to decarbonize residential heating, the two sectors should coordinate when planning future operations and infrastructure needs. Results from the MIT analysis indicate that such cooperation could significantly reduce both emissions and costs for residential heating — a change that would yield a much-needed step toward decarbonizing the buildings sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has transformed the landscape of water and food research at MIT, driving faculty engagement and catalyzing new research and innovation in these critical areas. With philanthropic, corporate, and government support, J-WAFS’ strategic approach spans the entire research life cycle, from support for early-stage research to commercialization grants for more advanced projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, J-WAFS has invested approximately $25 million in direct research funding to support MIT faculty pursuing transformative research with the potential for significant impact. “Since awarding our first cohort of seed grants in 2015, it’s remarkable to look back and see that over 10 percent of the MIT faculty have benefited from J-WAFS funding,” observes J-WAFS Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “Many of these professors hadn’t worked on water or food challenges before their first J-WAFS grant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and supporting high-risk, high-reward projects, J-WAFS has amplified the capacity of MIT faculty to pursue groundbreaking research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges facing our water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing MIT faculty to water and food research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS open calls for proposals enable faculty to explore bold ideas and develop impactful approaches to tackling critical water and food system challenges. Professor Patrick Doyle’s work in water purification exemplifies this impact. “Without J-WAFS, I would have never ventured into the field of water purification,” Doyle reflects. While previously focused on pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug delivery, exposure to J-WAFS-funded peers led him to apply his expertise in soft materials to water purification. “Both the funding and the J-WAFS community led me to be deeply engaged in understanding some of the key challenges in water purification and water security,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Professor Otto Cordero of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) leveraged J-WAFS funding to pivot his research into aquaculture. Cordero explains that his first J-WAFS seed grant “has been extremely influential for my lab because it allowed me to take a step in a new direction, with no preliminary data in hand.” Cordero’s expertise is in microbial communities. He was previous unfamiliar with aquaculture, but he saw the relevance of microbial communities the health of farmed aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting early-career faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New assistant professors at MIT have particularly benefited from J-WAFS funding and support. J-WAFS has played a transformative role in shaping the careers and research trajectories of many new faculty members by encouraging them to explore novel research areas, and in many instances providing their first MIT research grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ariel Furst reflects on how pivotal J-WAFS’ investment has been in advancing her research. “This was one of the first grants I received after starting at MIT, and it has truly shaped the development of my group’s research program,” Furst explains. With J-WAFS’ backing, her lab has achieved breakthroughs in chemical detection and remediation technologies for water. “The support of J-WAFS has enabled us to develop the platform funded through this work beyond the initial applications to the general detection of environmental contaminants and degradation of those contaminants,” she elaborates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karthish Manthiram, now a professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at Caltech, explains how J-WAFS’ early investment enabled him and other young faculty to pursue ambitious ideas. “J-WAFS took a big risk on us,” Manthiram reflects. His research on breaking the nitrogen triple bond to make ammonia for fertilizer was initially met with skepticism. However, J-WAFS’ seed funding allowed his lab to lay the groundwork for breakthroughs that later attracted significant National Science Foundation (NSF) support. “That early funding from J-WAFS has been pivotal to our long-term success,” he notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories underscore the broad impact of J-WAFS’ support for early-career faculty, and its commitment to empowering them to address critical global challenges and innovate boldly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fueling follow-on funding&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS seed grants enable faculty to explore nascent research areas, but external funding for continued work is usually necessary to achieve the full potential of these novel ideas. “It’s often hard to get funding for early stage or out-of-the-box ideas,” notes J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “My hope, when I founded J-WAFS in 2014, was that seed grants would allow PIs [principal investigators] to prove out novel ideas so that they would be attractive for follow-on funding. And after 10 years, J-WAFS-funded research projects have brought more than $21 million in subsequent awards to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Retsef Levi led a seed study on how agricultural supply chains affect food safety, with a team of faculty spanning the MIT schools&amp;nbsp;Engineering and Science as well as the MIT Sloan School of Management. The team parlayed their seed grant research into a multi-million-dollar follow-on initiative. Levi reflects, “The J-WAFS seed funding allowed us to establish the initial credibility of our team, which was key to our success in obtaining large funding from several other agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Des Marais was an assistant professor in the Department of CEE when he received his first J-WAFS seed grant. The funding supported his research on how plant growth and physiology are controlled by genes and interact with the environment. The seed grant helped launch his lab’s work addressing enhancing climate change resilience in agricultural systems. The work led to his Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the NSF, a prestigious honor for junior faculty members. Now an associate professor, Des Marais’ ongoing project to further investigate the mechanisms and consequences of genomic and environmental interactions is supported by the five-year, $1,490,000 NSF grant. “J-WAFS providing essential funding to get my new research underway,” comments Des Marais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Marais’ seed grant was also key to developing new collaborations. He explains, “the J-WAFS grant supported me to develop a collaboration with Professor Caroline Uhler in EECS/IDSS [the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Data, Systems, and Society] that really shaped how I think about framing and testing hypotheses. One of the best things about J-WAFS is facilitating unexpected connections among MIT faculty with diverse yet complementary skill sets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors A. John Hart of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Benedetto Marelli of CEE also launched a new interdisciplinary collaboration with J-WAFS funding. They partnered to join expertise in biomaterials, microfabrication, and manufacturing, to create printed silk-based colorimetric sensors that detect food spoilage. “The J-WAFS Seed Grant provided a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary collaboration,” Hart notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors Stephen Graves in the MIT Sloan School of Management and Bishwapriya Sanyal in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) partnered to pursue new research on agricultural supply chains. With field work in Senegal, their J-WAFS-supported project brought together international development specialists and operations management experts to study how small firms and government agencies influence access to and uptake of irrigation technology by poorer farmers. “We used J-WAFS to spur a collaboration that would have been improbable without this grant,” they explain. Being part of the J-WAFS community also introduced them to researchers in Professor Amos Winter’s lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working on irrigation technologies for low-resource settings. DUSP doctoral candidate Mark Brennan notes, “We got to share our understanding of how irrigation markets and irrigation supply chains work in developing economies, and then we got to contrast that with their understanding of how irrigation system models work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Swager, professor of chemistry, and Rohit Karnik, professor of mechanical engineering and J-WAFS associate director, collaborated on a sponsored research project supported by Xylem, Inc. through the J-WAFS Research Affiliate program. The cross-disciplinary research, which targeted the development of ultra-sensitive sensors for toxic PFAS chemicals, was conceived following a series of workshops hosted by J-WAFS. Swager and Karnik were two of the participants, and their involvement led to the collaborative proposal that Xylem funded. “J-WAFS funding allowed us to combine Swager lab’s expertise in sensing with my lab’s expertise in microfluidics to develop a cartridge for field-portable detection of PFAS,” says Karnik. “J-WAFS has enriched my research program in so many ways,” adds Swager, who is now working to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving global collaboration and impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS has also helped MIT faculty establish and advance international collaboration and impactful global research. By funding and supporting projects that connect MIT researchers with international partners, J-WAFS has not only advanced technological solutions, but also strengthened cross-cultural understanding and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Shoulders leads the inaugural J-WAFS Grand Challenge project. In response to the first J-WAFS call for “Grand Challenge” proposals, Shoulders assembled an interdisciplinary team based at MIT to enhance and provide climate resilience to agriculture by improving the most inefficient aspect of photosynthesis, the notoriously-inefficient carbon dioxide-fixing plant enzyme RuBisCO. J-WAFS funded this high-risk/high-reward project following a competitive process that engaged external reviewers through a several rounds of iterative proposal development. The technical feedback to the team led them to researchers with complementary expertise&amp;nbsp;from the Australian National University. “Our collaborative team of biochemists and synthetic biologists, computational biologists, and chemists is deeply integrated with plant biologists and field trial experts, yielding a robust feedback loop for enzyme engineering,” Shoulders says. “Together, this team will be able to make a concerted effort using the most modern, state-of-the-art techniques to engineer crop RuBisCO with an eye to helping make meaningful gains in securing a stable crop supply, hopefully with accompanying improvements in both food and water security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Leon Glicksman and Research Engineer Eric Verploegen’s team designed a low-cost cooling chamber to preserve fruits and vegetables harvested by smallholder farmers with no access to cold chain storage. J-WAFS’ guidance motivated the team to prioritize practical considerations informed by local collaborators, ensuring market competitiveness. “As our new idea for a forced-air evaporative cooling chamber was taking shape, we continually checked that our solution was evolving in a direction that would be competitive in terms of cost, performance, and usability to existing commercial alternatives,” explains Verploegen, who is currently an MIT D-Lab affiliate. Following the team’s initial seed grant, the team secured a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization grant, which Verploegen say “further motivated us to establish partnerships with local organizations capable of commercializing the technology earlier in the project than we might have done otherwise.” The team has since shared an open-source design as part of its commercialization strategy to maximize accessibility and impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing corporate sponsored research opportunities to MIT faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS also plays a role in driving private partnerships, enabling collaborations that bridge industry and academia. Through its Research Affiliate Program, for example, J-WAFS provides opportunities for faculty to collaborate with industry on sponsored research, helping to convert scientific discoveries into licensable intellectual property (IP) that companies can turn into commercial products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS introduced professor of mechanical engineering Alex Slocum to a challenge presented by its research affiliate company, Xylem: how to design a more energy-efficient pump for fluctuating flows. With centrifugal pumps consuming an estimated 6 percent of U.S. electricity annually, Slocum and his then-graduate student Hilary Johnson SM '18, PhD '22 developed an innovative variable volute mechanism that reduces energy usage. “Xylem envisions this as the first in a new category of adaptive pump geometry,” comments Johnson. The research produced a pump prototype and related IP that Xylem is working on commercializing. Johnson notes that these outcomes “would not have been possible without J-WAFS support and facilitation of the Xylem industry partnership.” Slocum adds, “J-WAFS enabled Hilary to begin her work on pumps, and Xylem sponsored the research to bring her to this point … where she has an opportunity to do far more than the original project called for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swager speaks highly of the impact of corporate research sponsorship through J-WAFS on his research and technology translation efforts. His PFAS project with Karnik described above was also supported by Xylem. “Xylem was an excellent sponsor of our research. Their engagement and feedback were instrumental in advancing our PFAS detection technology, now on the path to commercialization,” Swager says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What J-WAFS has accomplished is more than a collection of research projects; a decade of impact demonstrates how J-WAFS’ approach has been transformative for many MIT faculty members. As Professor Mathias Kolle puts it, his engagement with J-WAFS “had a significant influence on how we think about our research and its broader impacts.” He adds that it “opened my eyes to the challenges in the field of water and food systems and the many different creative ideas that are explored by MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thriving ecosystem of innovation, collaboration, and academic growth around water and food research has not only helped faculty build interdisciplinary and international partnerships, but has also led to the commercialization of transformative technologies with real-world applications. C. Cem Taşan, the POSCO Associate Professor of Metallurgy who is leading a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization team that is about to launch a startup company, sums it up by noting, “Without J-WAFS, we wouldn’t be here at all.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS looks to the future, its continued commitment — supported by the generosity of its donors and partners — builds on a decade of success enabling MIT faculty to advance water and food research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Pivot Bio is using microbial nitrogen to make agriculture more sustainable</title>

  <description><![CDATA[The nitrogen product developed by the company, which was co-founded by Professor Chris Voigt, is being used across millions of acres of American farmland.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Haber-Bosch process, which converts atmospheric nitrogen to make ammonia fertilizer, revolutionized agriculture and helped feed the world’s growing population, but it also created huge environmental problems. It is one of the most energy-intensive chemical processes in the world, responsible for 1-2 percent of global energy consumption. It also releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that harms the ozone layer. Excess nitrogen also routinely runs off farms into waterways, harming marine life and polluting groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In place of synthetic fertilizer, Pivot Bio has engineered nitrogen-producing microbes to make farming more sustainable. The company, which was co-founded by Professor Chris Voigt, Karsten Temme, and Alvin Tamsir, has engineered its microbes to grow on plant roots, where they feed on the root’s sugars and precisely deliver nitrogen in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s microbial colonies grow with the plant and produce more nitrogen at exactly the time the plant needs it, minimizing nitrogen runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way we have delivered nutrients to support plant growth historically is fertilizer, but that’s an inefficient way to get all the nutrients you need,” says Temme, Pivot’s chief innovation officer. “We have the ability now to help farmers be more efficient and productive with microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can replace up to 40 pounds per acre of traditional nitrogen with Pivot’s product, which amounts to about a quarter of the total nitrogen needed for a crop like corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s products are already being used to grow corn, wheat, barley, oats, and other grains across millions of acres of American farmland, eliminating hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 equivalent in the process. The company’s impact is even more striking given its unlikely origins, which trace back to one of the most challenging times of Voigt’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Pivot from despair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of every faculty member’s career can be a sink-or-swim moment, and by Voigt’s own account, he was drowning. As a freshly minted assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco, Voigt was struggling to stand up his lab, attract funding, and get experiments started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2008, Voigt joined a research group out of the University of California at Berkeley that was writing a grant proposal focused on photovoltaic materials. His initial role was minor, but a senior researcher pulled out of the group a week before the proposal had to be submitted, so Voigt stepped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said ‘I’ll finish this section in a week,’” Voigt recalls. “It was my big chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the proposal, Voigt detailed an ambitious plan to rearrange the genetics of biologic photosynthetic systems to make them more efficient. He barely submitted it in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months went by, then the proposal reviews finally came back. Voigt hurried to the meeting with some of the most senior researchers at UC Berkeley to discuss the responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My part of the proposal got completely slammed,” Voigt says. “There were something like 15 reviews on it — they were longer than the actual grant — and it’s just one after another tearing into my proposal. All the most famous people are in this meeting, future energy secretaries, future leaders of the university, and it was totally embarrassing. After that meeting, I was considering leaving academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few discouraging months later, Voigt got a call from Paul Ludden, the dean of the School of Science at UC Berkeley. He wanted to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I walk into Paul’s office, he’s reading my proposal,” Voigt recalls. “He sits me down and says, ‘Everybody’s telling me how terrible this is.’ I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God.’ But then he says, ‘I think there’s something here. Your idea is good, you just picked the wrong system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludden went on to explain to Voigt that he should apply his gene-swapping idea to nitrogen fixation. He even offered to send Voigt a postdoc from his lab, Dehua Zhao, to help. Voigt paired Zhao with Temme, and sure enough, the resulting 2011 paper of their work was well-received by the nitrogen fixation community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nitrogen fixation has been a holy grail for scientists, agronomists, and farmers for almost a century, ever since somebody discovered the first microbe that can fix nitrogen for legumes like soybeans,” Temme says. “Everybody always said that someday we'll be able to do this for the cereal crops. The excitement with Pivot was this is the first time that technology became accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voigt had moved to MIT in 2010. When the paper came out, he founded Pivot Bio with Temme and another Berkeley researcher, Alvin Tamsir. Since then, Voigt, who is the Daniel I.C. Wang Professor at MIT and the head of the Department of Biological Engineering, has continued collaborating with Pivot on things like increasing nitrogen production, making strains more stable, and making them inducible to different signals from the plant. Pivot has licensed technology from MIT, and the research has also received support from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s first goals were to gain regulatory approval and prove themselves in the marketplace. To gain approval in the U.S., Pivot’s team focused on using DNA from within the same organism rather than bringing in totally new DNA, which simplified the approval process. It also partnered with independent corn seed dealers to get its product to farms. Early deployments occurred in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers apply Pivot’s product at planting, either as a liquid that gets sprayed on the soil or as a dry powder that is rehydrated and applied to the seeds as a coating. The microbes live on the surface of the growing root system, eating plant sugars and releasing nitrogen throughout the plant’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, our microbes colonize just a fraction of the total sugars provided by the plant,” Temme explains. “They’re also sharing ammonia with the plant, and all of those things are just a portion of what’s possible technically. Our team is always trying to figure out how to make those microbes more efficient at getting the energy they need to grow or at fixing nitrogen and sharing it with the crop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Pivot started the N-Ovator program to connect companies with growers who practice sustainable farming using Pivot’s microbial nitrogen. Through the program, companies buy nitrogen credits and farmers can get paid by verifying their practices. The program was named one of the Inventions of the Year by &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; last year and has paid out millions of dollars to farmers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial nitrogen and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot is currently selling to farmers across the U.S. and working with smallholder farmers in Kenya. It’s also hoping to gain approval for its microbial solution in Brazil and Canada, which it hopes will be its next markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do we get the economics to make sense for everybody — the farmers, our partners, and the company?” Temme says of Pivot’s mission. “Because this truly can be a deflationary technology that upends the very expensive traditional way of making fertilizer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s team is also extending the product to cotton, and Temme says microbes can be a nitrogen source for any type of plant on the planet. Further down the line, the company believes it can help farmers with other nutrients essential to help their crops grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve established our technology, how can Pivot help farmers overcome all the other limitations they face with crop nutrients to maximize yields?” Temme asks. “That really starts to change the way a farmer thinks about managing the entire acre from a price, productivity, and sustainability perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gaining a better understanding of how people move through the spaces where they live and work could make those spaces safer and more sustainable. But no one wants cameras watching them 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two former Media Lab researchers think they have a solution. Their company, Butlr, offers places like skilled nursing facilities, offices, and senior living communities a way to understand how people are using buildings without compromising privacy. Butlr uses low-resolution thermal sensors and an analytics platform to help detect falls in elderly populations, save energy, and optimize spaces for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have this vision of using the right technology to understand people’s movements and behaviors in space,” says Jiani Zeng SM ’20, who co-founded Butlr with former Media Lab research affiliate Honghao Deng. “So many resources today go toward cameras and AI that take away people’s privacy. We believe we can make our environments safer, healthier, and more sustainable without violating privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the company has sold more than 20,000 of its privacy-preserving sensors to senior living and skilled nursing facilities as well as businesses with large building footprints, including Verizon, Netflix, and Microsoft. In the future, Butlr hopes to enable more dynamic spaces that can understand and respond to the ways people use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Space should be like a digital user interface: It should be multi-use and responsive to your needs,” Deng says. “If the office has a big room with people working individually, it should automatically separate into smaller rooms, or lights and temperature should be adjusted to save energy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building intelligence, with privacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Tianjin University in China, Deng joined the Media Lab’s City Science Group&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;as a visiting student&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;in 2016. He went on to complete his master’s at Harvard University, but he returned to the Media Lab as a research affiliate and led projects around what he calls responsive architecture: spaces that can understand their users’ needs through non-camera sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My vision of the future of building environments emerged from the Media Lab,” Deng says. “The real world is the largest user interface around us — it’s not the screens. We all live in a three-dimensional world and yet, unlike the digital world, this user interface doesn’t yet understand our needs, let alone the critical situations when someone falls in a room. That could be life-saving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeng came to MIT as a master’s student in the Integrated Design and Management program, which was run jointly out of the MIT Sloan School of Management and the School of Engineering. She also worked as a research assistant at the Media Lab and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair met during a hackathon at the Media Lab and continued collaborating on various projects. During that time, they worked with MIT’s Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) and the MIT I-Corps Program. When they graduated in 2019, they decided to start a company based on the idea of creating smart buildings with privacy-preserving sensors. Crucial early funding came from the Media Lab-affiliated E14 Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell every single MIT founder they should have the E14 Fund in their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_table" target="_blank"&gt;cap table&lt;/a&gt;,” Deng says. “They understand what it takes to go from an MIT student to a founder, and to transition from the ‘scientist brain’ to the ‘inventor brain.’ We wouldn’t be where we are today without MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray Stata ’57, SM ’58, the founder of Analog Devices, is also an investor in Butlr and serves as Butlr’s board director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would love to give back to the MIT community once we become successful entrepreneurs like Ray, whose advice and mentoring has been invaluable,” Deng says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After launching, the founders had to find the right early customers for their real-time sensors, which can discern rough body shapes but no personally identifiable information. They interviewed hundreds of people before starting with owners of office spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have zero baseline data on what’s happening in their workplace,” Deng says. “That’s especially true since the Covid-19 pandemic made people hybrid, which has opened huge opportunities to cut the energy use of large office spaces. Sometimes, the only people in these buildings are the receptionist and the cleaner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butlr’s multiyear, battery-powered sensors can track daily occupancy in each room and give other insights into space utilization that can be used to reduce energy use. For companies with a lot of office space, the opportunities are immense. One Butlr customer has 40 building leases. Deng says optimizing the HVAC controls based on usage could amount to millions of dollars saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can be like the Google Analytics for these spaces without any concerns in terms of privacy,” Deng says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders also knew the problem went well beyond office spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In skilled nursing facilities, instead of office spaces it’s individual rooms, all with people who may need the nurse’s help,” Deng says. “But the nurses have no visibility into what’s happening unless they physically enter the room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute care environments and senior living facilities are another key market for Butlr. The company’s platform can detect falls and instances when someone isn’t getting out of bed to alert staff. The system integrates with nurse calling systems to alert staff when something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “nerve cells” of the building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butlr is continuing to develop analytics that give important insights into spaces. For instance, today the platform can use information around movement in elderly populations to help detect problems like urinary tract infections. Butlr also recently started a collaboration with Harvard Medical School’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst’s Artificial Intelligence and Technology Center for Connected Care in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease. Through the project, Butlr will try to detect changes in movement that could indicate declining cognitive or physical abilities. Those insights could be used to provide aging patients with more supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the near term we are preventing falls, but the vision is when you look up in any buildings or homes, you’ll see Butlr,” Deng says. “This could allow older adults to age in place with dignity and privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More broadly, Butlr’s founders see their work as an important way to shape the future of AI technology, which is expected to be a growing part of everyone’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re the nerve cells in the building, not the eyes,” Deng says. “That’s the future of AI we believe in: AI that can transform regular rooms into spaces that understand people and can use that understanding to do everything from making efficiency improvements to saving lives in senior care communities. That’s the right way to use this powerful technology.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shreyaa Raghavan’s journey into solving some of the world’s toughest challenges started with a simple love for puzzles. By high school, her knack for problem-solving naturally drew her to computer science. Through her participation in an entrepreneurship and leadership program, she built apps and twice made it to the semifinals of the program’s global competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her early successes made a&amp;nbsp;computer science career seem like an obvious choice, but Raghavan says a significant competing interest left her torn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Computer science sparks that puzzle-, problem-solving part of my brain,” says Raghavan ’24, an Accenture Fellow and a PhD candidate in MIT’s Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. “But while I always felt like building mobile apps was a fun little hobby, it didn’t feel like I was directly solving societal challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her perspective shifted when, as an MIT undergraduate, Raghavan participated in an Undergraduate Research Opportunity in the Photovoltaic Research Laboratory, now known as the Accelerated Materials Laboratory for Sustainability. There, she discovered how computational techniques like machine learning could optimize materials for solar panels — a direct application of her skills toward mitigating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This lab had a very diverse group of people, some from a computer science background, some from a chemistry background, some who were hardcore engineers. All of them were communicating effectively and working toward one unified goal — building better renewable energy systems,” Raghavan says. “It opened my eyes to the fact that I could use very technical tools that I enjoy building and find fulfillment in that by helping solve major climate challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her sights set on applying machine learning and optimization to energy and climate, Raghavan joined Cathy Wu’s lab when she started her PhD in 2023. The lab focuses on building more sustainable transportation systems, a field that resonated with Raghavan due to its universal impact and its outsized role in climate change — transportation accounts for roughly 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we were to throw all of the intelligent systems we are exploring into the transportation networks, by how much could we reduce emissions?” she asks, summarizing a core question of her research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu, an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, stresses the value of Raghavan's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Transportation is a critical element of both the economy and climate change, so potential changes to transportation must be carefully studied,” Wu says. “Shreyaa’s research into smart congestion management is important because it takes a data-driven approach to add rigor to the broader research supporting sustainability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan’s contributions have been recognized with the Accenture Fellowship, a cornerstone of the MIT-Accenture Convergence Initiative for Industry and Technology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an Accenture Fellow, she is exploring the potential impact of technologies for avoiding stop-and-go traffic and its emissions, using systems such as networked autonomous vehicles and digital speed limits that vary according to traffic conditions — solutions that could advance decarbonization in the transportation section at relatively low cost and in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan says she appreciates the Accenture Fellowship not only for the support it provides, but also because it demonstrates industry involvement in sustainable transportation solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for the field of transportation, and also energy and climate as a whole, to synergize with all of the different stakeholders,” she says. “I think it’s important for industry to be involved in this issue of incorporating smarter transportation systems to decarbonize transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan has also received a fellowship supporting her research from the U.S. Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really exciting that there’s interest from the policy side with the Department of Transportation and from the industry side with Accenture,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan believes that addressing climate change requires collaboration across disciplines. “I think with climate change, no one industry or field is going to solve it on its own. It’s really got to be each field stepping up and trying to make a difference,” she says. “I don’t think there’s any silver-bullet solution to this problem. It’s going to take many different solutions from different people, different angles, different disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Raghavan has been very active in the MIT Energy and Climate Club since joining about three years ago, which, she says, “was a really cool way to meet lots of people who were working toward the same goal, the same climate goals, the same passions, but from completely different angles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Raghavan is on the community and education team, which works to build the community at MIT that is working on climate and energy issues. As part of that work, Raghavan is launching a mentorship program for undergraduates, pairing them with graduate students who help the undergrads develop ideas about how they can work on climate using their unique expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t foresee myself using my computer science skills in energy and climate,” Raghavan says, “so I really want to give other students a clear pathway, or a clear sense of how they can get involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raghavan has embraced her area of study even in terms of where she likes to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love working on trains, on buses, on airplanes,” she says. “It’s really fun to be in transit and working on transportation problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating a trip to New York to visit a cousin, she holds no dread for the long train trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know I’m going to do some of my best work during those hours,” she says. “Four hours there. Four hours back.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Cleaning up critical minerals and materials production, using microwave plasma</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/6K-cleans-critical-minerals-using-microwave-plasma-0207</link>
  <description><![CDATA[With technology developed at MIT, 6K is helping to bring critical materials production back to the U.S. without toxic byproducts.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. is running up against an unfortunate truth: The processes for making many critical materials today create toxic byproducts and other environmental hazards. That’s true for commonly used industrial metals like nickel and titanium, as well as specialty minerals, materials, and coatings that go into batteries, advanced electronics, and defense applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now 6K, founded by former MIT research scientist Kamal Hadidi, is using a new production process to bring &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals" target="_blank"&gt;critical materials&lt;/a&gt; production back to America without the toxic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is actively scaling its microwave plasma technology, which it calls UniMelt, to transform the way critical minerals are processed, creating new domestic supply chains in the process. UniMelt uses beams of tightly controlled thermal plasma to melt or vaporize precursor materials into particles with precise sizes and crystalline phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology converts metals, such as titanium, nickel, and refractory alloys, into particles optimized for additive manufacturing for a range of industrial applications. It is also being used to create battery materials for electric vehicles, grid infrastructure, and data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The markets and critical materials we are focused on are important for not just economic reasons but also U.S. national security, because the bulk of these materials are manufactured today in nonfriendly countries,” 6K CEO Saurabh Ullal says. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Now, the [U.S. government] and our growing customer base can leverage this technology invented at MIT to make the U.S. less dependent on these nonfriendly countries, ensuring supply chain independence now and in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named after the 6,000-degree temperature of its plasma, 6K is currently selling its high-performance metal powders to parts manufacturers as well as defense, automotive, medical, and oil and gas companies for use in applications from engine components and medical implants to rockets. To scale its battery materials business, 6K is also building a 100,000-square-foot production facility in Jackson, Tennessee, which will begin construction later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A weekend project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1994 and 2007, Hadidi worked at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PFSC), where he developed plasma technologies for a range of applications, including hydrogen production, fuel reforming, and detecting environmental toxins. His first company was founded in 2000 out of the PFSC to detect mercury in coal-fired power plants’ smokestacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I loved working at MIT,” Hadidi says. “It’s an amazing place that really challenges you. Just being there is so stimulating because everyone’s trying to come up with new solutions and connect dots between different fields.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadidi also began using high-frequency microwave plasmas to create nanomaterials for use in optical applications. He wasn’t a materials expert, so he collaborated with Professor Eric Jordan, a materials synthesis expert from the University of Connecticut, and the researchers started working on nights and weekends in the PSFC to develop the idea further, eventually patenting the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadidi officially founded the company as Amastan in 2007, exploring the use of his microwave plasma technology, later named UniMelt for “uniform melt state process,” to make a host of different materials as part of a government grant he and Jordan received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers soon realized the microwave plasma technology had several advantages over traditional production techniques for certain materials. For one, it could eliminate several high-energy steps of conventional processes, reducing production times from days to hours in some cases. For batteries and certain critical minerals, the process also works with recycled feedstocks. Amastan was renamed 6K in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, Hadidi produced metal powders used in additive manufacturing through a process called spheroidization, which results in dense, spherical powders that flow well and make high-performance 3D-printed parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following another grant, Hadidi explored methods for producing a type of battery cathode made from lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt (NMC). The standard process for making NMCs involved chemical synthesis, precipitation, heat treatment, and a lot of water. 6K is able to reduce many of those steps, speeding up production and lowering costs while also being more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our technology completely eliminates toxic waste and recycles all of the byproducts back through the process to utilize everything, including water,” Ullal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling domestic production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 6K’s additive manufacturing arm operates out of a factory in Pennsylvania. The company’s critical minerals processing, refining, and recycling systems can produce about 400 tons of material per year and can be used to make more than a dozen types of metal powders. The company also has 33,000-square-foot battery center in North Andover, Massachusetts, where it produces battery cathode materials for its energy storage and mobility customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee facility will be used to produce battery cathode materials and represents a massive step up in throughput. The company says it will be able to produce 13,000 tons of material annually when construction is complete next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy if what I started brings something positive to society, and I’m extremely thankful to all the people that helped me,” says Hadidi, who left the company in 2019. “I’m an entrepreneur at heart. I like to make things. But that doesn’t mean I always succeed. It’s personally very satisfying to see this make an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6K team says its technology can also create a variety of specialty ceramics, advanced coatings, and nanoengineered materials. They say it may also be used to eliminate PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” though that work is at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company recently received a grant to demonstrate a process for recycling critical materials from military depots to produce aerospace and defense products, creating a new value stream for these materials that would otherwise deteriorate or go to landfill. That work is consistent with the company’s motto, “We take nothing from the ground and put nothing into the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s additive division recently received a $23.4 Defense Production Act grant “that will enable us to double processing capacity in the next three years,” Ullal says. “The next step is to scale battery materials production to the tens of thousands of tons per year. At this point, it’s a scale-up of known processes, and we just need to execute. The idea of creating a circular economy is near and dear to us because that’s how we’ve built this company and that’s how we generate value: addressing our U.S. national security concerns and protecting the planet as well.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Streamlining data collection for improved salmon population management</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sara Beery came to MIT as an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) eager to focus on ecological challenges. She has fashioned her research career around the opportunity to apply her expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and data science to tackle real-world issues in conservation and sustainability. Beery was drawn to the Institute’s commitment to “computing for the planet,” and set out to bring her methods to global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Pacific Northwest, salmon have a disproportionate impact on the health of their ecosystems, and their complex reproductive needs have attracted Beery’s attention. Each year, millions of salmon embark on a migration to spawn. Their journey begins in freshwater stream beds where the eggs hatch. Young salmon fry (newly hatched salmon) make their way to the ocean, where they spend several years maturing to adulthood. As adults, the salmon return to the streams where they were born in order to spawn, ensuring the continuation of their species by depositing their eggs in the gravel of the stream beds. Both male and female salmon die shortly after supplying the river habitat with the next generation of salmon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout their migration, salmon support a wide range of organisms in the ecosystems they pass through. For example, salmon bring nutrients like carbon and nitrogen from the ocean upriver, enhancing their availability to those ecosystems. In addition, salmon are key to many predator-prey relationships: They serve as a food source for various predators, such as bears, wolves, and birds, while helping to control other populations, like insects, through predation. After they die from spawning, the decomposing salmon carcasses also replenish valuable nutrients to the surrounding ecosystem. The migration of salmon not only sustains their own species but plays a critical role in the overall health of the rivers and oceans they inhabit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, salmon populations play an important role both economically and culturally in the region. Commercial and recreational salmon fisheries contribute significantly to the local economy. And for many Indigenous peoples in the Pacific northwest, salmon hold notable cultural value, as they have been central to their diets, traditions, and ceremonies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring salmon migration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increased human activity, including overfishing and hydropower development, together with habitat loss and climate change, have had a significant impact on salmon populations in the region. As a result, effective monitoring and management of salmon fisheries is important to ensure balance among competing ecological, cultural, and human interests. Accurately counting salmon during their seasonal migration to their natal river to spawn is essential in order to track threatened populations, assess the success of recovery strategies, guide fishing season regulations, and support the management of both commercial and recreational fisheries. Precise population data help decision-makers employ the best strategies to safeguard the health of the ecosystem while accommodating human needs. Monitoring salmon migration is a labor-intensive and inefficient undertaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beery is currently leading a research project that aims to streamline salmon monitoring using cutting-edge computer vision methods. This project fits within Beery’s broader research interest, which focuses on the interdisciplinary space between artificial intelligence, the natural world, and sustainability. Its relevance to fisheries management made it a good fit for funding from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS). Beery’s 2023 J-WAFS seed grant was the first research funding she was awarded since joining the MIT faculty. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, monitoring efforts relied on humans to manually count salmon from riverbanks using eyesight. In the past few decades, underwater sonar systems have been implemented to aid in counting the salmon. These sonar systems are essentially underwater video cameras, but they differ in that they use acoustics instead of light sensors to capture the presence of a fish. Use of this method requires people to set up a tent alongside the river to count salmon based on the output of a sonar camera that is hooked up to a laptop. While this system is an improvement to the original method of monitoring salmon by eyesight, it still relies significantly on human effort and is an arduous and time-consuming process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automating salmon monitoring is necessary for better management of salmon fisheries. “We need these technological tools,” says Beery. “We can’t keep up with the demand of monitoring and understanding and studying these really complex ecosystems that we work in without some form of automation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to automate counting of migrating salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest, the project team, including Justin Kay, a PhD student in EECS, has been collecting data in the form of videos from sonar cameras at different rivers. The team annotates a subset of the data to train the computer vision system to autonomously detect and count the fish as they migrate. Kay describes the process of how the model counts each migrating fish: “The computer vision algorithm is designed to locate a fish in the frame, draw a box around it, and then track it over time. If a fish is detected on one side of the screen and leaves on the other side of the screen, then we count it as moving upstream.” On rivers where the team has created training data for the system, it has produced strong results, with only 3 to 5 percent counting error. This is well below the target that the team and partnering stakeholders set of no more than a 10 percent counting error.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and deployment: Balancing human effort and use of automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers’ technology is being deployed to monitor the migration of salmon on the newly restored Klamath River. Four dams on the river were recently demolished, making it the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The dams came down after a more than 20-year-long campaign to remove them, which was led by Klamath tribes, in collaboration with scientists, environmental organizations, and commercial fishermen. After the removal of the dams, 240 miles of the river now flow freely and nearly 800 square miles of habitat are accessible to salmon. Beery notes the almost immediate regeneration of salmon populations in the Klamath River: “I think it was within eight days of the dam coming down, they started seeing salmon actually migrate upriver beyond the dam.” In a collaboration with California Trout, the team is currently processing new data to adapt and create a customized model that can then be deployed to help count the newly migrating salmon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One challenge with the system revolves around training the model to accurately count the fish in unfamiliar environments with variations such as riverbed features, water clarity, and lighting conditions. These factors can significantly alter how the fish appear on the output of a sonar camera and confuse the computer model. When deployed in new rivers where no data have been collected before, like the Klamath, the performance of the system degrades and the margin of error increases substantially to 15-20 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers constructed an automatic adaptation algorithm within the system to overcome this challenge and create a scalable system that can be deployed to any site without human intervention. This self-initializing technology works to automatically calibrate to the new conditions and environment to accurately count the migrating fish. In testing, the automatic adaptation algorithm was able to reduce the counting error down to the 10 to 15 percent range. The improvement in counting error with the self-initializing function means that the technology is closer to being deployable to new locations without much additional human effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling real-time management with the “Fishbox”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another challenge faced by the research team was the development of an efficient data infrastructure. In order to run the computer vision system, the video produced by sonar cameras must be delivered via the cloud or by manually mailing hard drives from a river site to the lab. These methods have notable drawbacks: a cloud-based approach is limited due to lack of internet connectivity in remote river site locations, and shipping the data introduces problems of delay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of relying on these methods, the team has implemented a power-efficient computer, coined the “Fishbox,” that can be used in the field to perform the processing. The Fishbox consists of a small, lightweight computer with optimized software that fishery managers can plug into their existing laptops and sonar cameras. The system is then capable of running salmon counting models directly at the sonar sites without the need for internet connectivity. This allows managers to make hour-by-hour decisions, supporting more responsive, real-time management of salmon populations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team is also working to bring a community together around monitoring for salmon fisheries management in the Pacific Northwest. “It’s just pretty exciting to have stakeholders who are enthusiastic about getting access to [our technology] as we get it to work and having a tighter integration and collaboration with them,” says Beery. “I think particularly when you’re working on food and water systems, you need direct collaboration to help facilitate impact, because you're ensuring that what you develop is actually serving the needs of the people and organizations that you are helping to support.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past June, Beery’s lab organized a workshop in Seattle that convened nongovernmental organizations, tribes, and state and federal departments of fish and wildlife to discuss the use of automated sonar systems to monitor and manage salmon populations. Kay notes that the workshop was an “awesome opportunity to have everybody sharing different ways that they're using sonar and thinking about how the automated methods that we’re building could fit into that workflow.” The discussion continues now via a shared Slack channel created by the team, with over 50 participants. Convening this group is a significant achievement, as many of these organizations would not otherwise have had an opportunity to come together and collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team continues to tune the computer vision system, refine their technology, and engage with diverse stakeholders — from Indigenous communities to fishery managers — the project is poised to make significant improvements to the efficiency and accuracy of salmon monitoring and management in the region. And as Beery advances the work of her MIT group, the J-WAFS seed grant is helping to keep challenges such as fisheries management in her sights. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the J-WAFS seed grant existed here at MIT enabled us to continue to work on this project when we moved here,” comments Beery, adding “it also expanded the scope of the project and allowed us to maintain active collaboration on what I think is a really important and impactful project.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS marks its 10th anniversary this year, the program aims to continue supporting and encouraging MIT faculty to pursue innovative projects that aim to advance knowledge and create practical solutions with real-world impacts on global water and food system challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human activities continue to pump billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, raising global temperatures and driving extreme weather events. As countries grapple with climate impacts and ways to significantly reduce carbon emissions, there have been various efforts to advance carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies that directly remove carbon dioxide from the air and sequester it for long periods of time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike carbon capture and storage technologies, which are designed to remove carbon dioxide at point sources such as fossil-fuel plants, CDR aims to remove carbon dioxide molecules that are already circulating in the atmosphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/reports/atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-removal" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by the American Physical Society and led by an MIT physicist provides an overview of the major experimental CDR approaches and determines their fundamental physical limits. The report focuses on methods that have the biggest potential for removing carbon dioxide, at the scale of gigatons per year, which is the magnitude that would be required to have a climate-stabilizing impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new report was commissioned by the American Physical Society's Panel on Public Affairs, and appeared last week in the journal&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;PRX&lt;em&gt;. The report was chaired by&amp;nbsp;MIT professor of physics Washington Taylor, who spoke with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; about CDR’s physical limitations and why it’s worth pursuing in tandem with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What motivated you to look at carbon dioxide removal systems from a physical science perspective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The number one thing driving climate change is the fact that we’re taking carbon that has been stuck in the ground for 100 million years, and putting it in the atmosphere, and that’s causing warming. In the last few years there’s been a lot of interest both by the government and private entities in finding technologies to directly remove the CO2 from the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to manage atmospheric carbon is the&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;critical question in dealing with our impact on Earth’s climate. So, it’s very important for us to understand whether we can affect the carbon levels not just by changing our emissions profile but also by directly taking carbon out of the atmosphere. Physics has a lot to say about this because the possibilities are very strongly constrained by thermodynamics, mass issues, and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What carbon dioxide removal methods did you evaluate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;They’re all at an early stage. It's kind of the Wild West out there in terms of the different ways in which companies are proposing to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In this report, we break down CDR processes into two classes: cyclic and once-through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine we are in a boat that has a hole in the hull and is rapidly taking on water.&amp;nbsp;Of course, we want to plug the hole as quickly as we can.&amp;nbsp;But even once we have fixed the hole, we need to get the water out so we aren't in danger of sinking or getting swamped.&amp;nbsp;And this is particularly urgent if we haven't completely fixed the hole so we still have a slow leak.&amp;nbsp;Now, imagine we have a couple of options for how to get the water out so we don’t sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is a sponge that we can use to absorb water, that we can then squeeze out and reuse. That’s a cyclic process in the sense that we have some material that we’re using over and over. There are cyclic CDR processes like chemical “direct air capture” (DAC), which acts basically like a sponge. You set up a big system with fans that blow air past some material that captures carbon dioxide. When the material is saturated, you close off the system and then use energy&amp;nbsp;to essentially squeeze out the carbon and store it in a deep repository. Then you can reuse the material, in a cyclic process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second class of approaches is what we call “once-through.” In the boat analogy, it would be as if you try to fix the leak using cartons of paper towels. You let them saturate and then throw them overboard, and you use each roll once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are once-through CDR approaches, like enhanced rock weathering, that are designed to accelerate a natural process, by which certain rocks, when exposed to air, will absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Worldwide, this natural rock weathering is estimated to remove about 1 gigaton of carbon each year. “Enhanced rock weathering” is a CDR approach where you would dig up a lot of this rock, grind it up really small, to less than the width of a human hair, to get the process to happen much faster. The idea is, you dig up something, spread it out, and absorb CO2 in one go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference between these two processes is that the cyclic process is subject to the second law of thermodynamics and there’s an energy constraint. You can set an actual limit from physics, saying any cyclic process is going to take a certain amount of energy, and that cannot be avoided. For example, we find that for cyclic direct-air-capture (DAC) plants, based on second law limits, the absolute minimum amount of energy you would need&amp;nbsp;to capture a gigaton of carbon is comparable to the total yearly electric energy consumption of the state of Virginia. Systems currently under development use at least three to 10 times this much energy on a per ton basis (and capture tens of thousands, not billions, of tons).&amp;nbsp;Such systems also need to move a lot of air; the air that would need to pass through a DAC system to capture a gigaton of CO2 is comparable to the amount of air that passes through&amp;nbsp;all the air cooling systems on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you have a once-through process, you could in some respects avoid the energy constraint, but now you’ve got a materials constraint due to the central laws of chemistry. For once-through processes like enhanced rock weathering, that means that if you want to capture a gigaton of CO2, roughly speaking, you’re going to need a billion tons of rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, to capture gigatons of carbon through engineered methods requires tremendous amounts of physical material, air movement, and energy. On the other hand, everything we’re doing to put that CO2 in the atmosphere is extensive too, so large-scale emissions reductions face comparable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What does the report conclude, in terms of whether and how to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Our initial prejudice was, CDR is just going to take so much energy, and there’s no way around that because of the second law of thermodynamics, regardless of the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as we discussed, there is this nuance about cyclic versus once-through systems.&amp;nbsp;And there are two points of view that we ended up threading a needle between. One is the view that CDR is a silver bullet, and we’ll just do CDR and not worry about emissions — we’ll just suck it all out of the atmosphere. And that’s not the case. It will be really expensive, and will take a lot of energy and materials to&amp;nbsp;do large-scale CDR. But there’s another view, where people say, don’t even think about CDR. Even thinking about CDR will compromise our efforts toward emissions reductions. The report comes down somewhere in the middle, saying that CDR is not a magic bullet, but also not a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are serious about managing climate change, we will likely want substantial CDR in addition to aggressive emissions reductions.&amp;nbsp;The report concludes that research and development on CDR methods should be selectively and prudently pursued despite the expected cost and energy and material requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a policy level, the main message is that we need an economic and policy framework that incentivizes emissions reductions and CDR in a common framework; this would naturally allow the market to optimize climate solutions. Since in many cases it is much easier and cheaper to cut emissions than it will likely ever be to remove atmospheric carbon, clearly understanding the challenges of CDR should help motivate rapid emissions reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I’m optimistic in the sense that scientifically we understand what it will take to reduce emissions and to use CDR to bring CO2 levels down to a slightly lower level. Now, it’s really a societal and economic problem. I think humanity has the potential to solve these problems. I hope that we can find common ground so that we can take actions as a society that will benefit both humanity and the broader ecosystems on the planet, before we end up having bigger problems than we already have.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Andrew Babbin tries to pack light for work trips. Along with the travel essentials, though, he also brings&amp;nbsp;a roll each of electrical tape, duct tape, lab tape, a pack of cable ties, and some bungee cords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my MacGyver kit: You never know when you have to rig something on the fly in the field or fix a broken bag,” Babbin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trips Babbin takes are far out to sea, on month-long cruises, where he works to sample waters off the Pacific coast and out in the open ocean. In remote locations, repair essentials often come in handy, as when Babbin had to zip-tie a wrench to a sampling device to help it sink through an icy Antarctic lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin is an oceanographer and marine biogeochemist who studies marine microbes and the ways in which they control the cycling of nitrogen between the ocean and the atmosphere. This exchange helps maintain healthy ocean ecosystems and supports the ocean’s capacity to store carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining measurements that he takes in the ocean with experiments in his MIT lab, Babbin is working to understand the connections between microbes and ocean nitrogen, which could in turn help scientists identify ways to maintain the ocean’s health and productivity. His work has taken him to many coastal and open-ocean regions around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You really become an oceanographer and an Earth scientist to see the world,” says Babbin, who&amp;nbsp;recently earned tenure as&amp;nbsp;the Cecil and Ida Green Career Development Professor in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “We embrace the diversity of places and cultures on this planet. To see just a small fraction of that is special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A powerful cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ocean has been a constant presence for Babbin since childhood. His family is from Monmouth County, New Jersey, where he and his twin sister grew up playing along the Jersey shore. When they were teenagers, their parents took the kids on family cruise vacations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always loved being on the water,” he says. “My favorite parts of any of those cruises were the days at sea, where you were just in the middle of some ocean basin with water all around you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In school, Babbin gravitated to the sciences, and chemistry in particular. After high school, he attended Columbia University, where a visit to the school’s Earth and environmental engineering department catalyzed a realization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, it was always this excitement about the water and about chemistry, and it was this pop of, ‘Oh wow, it doesn’t have to be one or the other,’” Babbin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He chose to major in Earth and environmental engineering, with a concentration in water resources and climate risks. After graduating in 2008, Babbin returned to his home state, where he attended Princeton University and set a course for a PhD in geosciences, with a focus on chemical oceanography and environmental microbiology. His advisor, oceanographer Bess Ward, took Babbin on as a member of her research group and invited him on several month-long cruises to various parts of the eastern tropical Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still remember that first trip,” Babbin recalls. “It was a whirlwind. Everyone else had been to sea a gazillion times and was loading the boat and strapping things down, and I had no idea of anything. And within a few hours, I was doing an experiment as the ship rocked back and forth!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin learned to deploy sampling cannisters overboard, then haul them back up and analyze the seawater inside for signs of nitrogen — an essential nutrient for all living things on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the plants and animals that depend on nitrogen to survive are unable to take it up from the atmosphere themselves. They require a sort of go-between, in the form of microbes that “fix” nitrogen, converting it from nitrogen gas to more digestible forms. In the ocean, this nitrogen fixation is done by highly specialized microbial species, which work to make nitrogen available to phytoplankton — microscopic plant-like organisms that are the foundation of the marine food chain. Phytoplankton are also a main route by which the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms may also use these biologically available forms of nitrogen for energy under certain conditions, returning nitrogen to the atmosphere. These microbes can also release a byproduct of nitrous oxide, which is a potent greenhouse gas that also can catalyze ozone loss in the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through his graduate work, at sea and in the lab, Babbin became fascinated with the cycling of nitrogen and the role that nitrogen-fixing microbes play in supporting the ocean’s ecosystems and the climate overall. A balance of nitrogen inputs and outputs sustains phytoplankton and maintains the ocean’s ability to soak up carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the really pressing questions in ocean biogeochemistry pertain to this cycling of nitrogen,” Babbin says. “Understanding the ways in which this one element cycles through the ocean, and how it is central to ecosystem health and the planet’s climate, has been really powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the lab and out to sea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing his PhD in 2014, Babbin arrived at MIT as a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My first feeling when I came here was, wow, this really is a nerd’s playground,” Babbin says. “I embraced being part of a culture where we seek to understand the world better, while also doing the things we really want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, he accepted a faculty position in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. He set up his laboratory space, painted in his favorite brilliant orange, on the top floor of the Green Building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His group uses 3D printers to fabricate microfluidic devices in which they reproduce the conditions of the ocean environment and study microbe metabolism and its effects on marine chemistry. In the field, Babbin has led research expeditions to the Galapagos Islands and parts of the eastern Pacific, where he has collected and analyzed samples of air and water for signs of nitrogen transformations and microbial activity. His new measuring station in the Galapagos is able to infer marine emissions of nitrous oxide across a large swath of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. His group has also sailed to southern Cuba, where the researchers studied interactions of microbes in coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Babbin traveled to Antarctica, where he set up camp next to frozen lakes and plumbed for samples of pristine ice water that he will analyze for genetic remnants of ancient microbes. Such preserved bacterial DNA could help scientists understand how microbes evolved and influenced the Earth’s climate over billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microbes are the terraformers,” Babbin notes. “They have been, since life evolved more than 3 billion years ago. We have to think about how they shape the natural world and how they will respond to the Anthropocene as humans monkey with the planet ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbin is now charting new research directions. In addition to his work at sea and in the lab, he is venturing into engineering, with a new project to design denitrifying capsules. While nitrogen is an essential nutrient for maintaining a marine ecosystem, too much nitrogen, such as from fertilizer that runs off into lakes and streams, can generate blooms of toxic algae. Babbin is looking to design eco-friendly capsules that scrub excess anthropogenic nitrogen from local waterways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also beginning the process of designing a new sensor to measure low-oxygen concentrations in the ocean. As the planet warms, the oceans are losing oxygen, creating “dead zones” where fish cannot survive. While others including Babbin have tried to map these oxygen minimum zones, or OMZs, they have done so sporadically, by dropping sensors into the ocean over limited range, depth, and times. Babbin’s sensors could potentially provide a more complete map of OMZs, as they would be deployed on wide-ranging, deep-diving, and naturally propulsive vehicles: sharks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to measure oxygen. Sharks need oxygen. And if you look at where the sharks don’t go, you might have a sense of where the oxygen is not,” says Babbin, who is working with marine biologists on ways to tag sharks with oxygen sensors. “A number of these large pelagic fish move up and down the water column frequently, so you can map the depth to which they dive to, and infer something about the behavior. And my suggestion is, you might also infer something about the ocean’s chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he reflects on what stimulates new ideas and research directions, Babbin credits working with others, in his own group and across MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My best thoughts come from this collective action,” Babbin says. “Particularly because we all have different upbringings and approach things from a different perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s bringing this collaborative spirit to his new role, as a mission director for MIT’s Climate Project. Along with Jesse Kroll, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering and of chemical engineering, Babbin co-leads one of the project’s six missions: Restoring the Atmosphere, Protecting the Land and Oceans. Babbin and Kroll are planning a number of workshops across campus that they hope will generate new connections, and spark new ideas, particularly around ways to evaluate the effectiveness of different climate mitigation strategies and better assess the impacts of climate on society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One area we want to promote is thinking of climate science and climate interventions as two sides of the same coin,” Babbin says. “There’s so much action that’s trying to be catalyzed. But we want it to be the best action. Because we really have one shot at doing this. Time is of the essence.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;David McGee, the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT, was recently appointed head of the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), effective Jan. 15. He assumes the role from Professor Robert van der Hilst, the Schlumberger Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, who &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/robert-van-der-hilst-steps-down-as-eaps-head-1106"&gt;led the department&lt;/a&gt; for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee specializes in applying isotope geochemistry and geochronology to reconstruct Earth’s climate history, helping to ground-truth our understanding of how the climate system responds during periods of rapid change. He has also been instrumental in the growth of the department’s community and culture, having served as EAPS associate department head since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David is an amazing researcher who brings crucial, data-based insights to aid our response to climate change,” says dean of the School of Science and the Curtis (1963) and Kathleen Marble Professor of Astrophysics Nergis Mavalvala. “He is also a committed and caring educator, providing extraordinary investment in his students’ learning experiences, and through his direction of Terrascope, one of our unique first-year learning communities focused on generating solutions to sustainability challenges.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am energized by the incredible EAPS community, by Rob’s leadership over the last 13 years, and by President Kornbluth’s call for MIT to innovate effective and wise responses to climate change,” says McGee. “EAPS has a unique role in this time of reckoning with planetary boundaries — our collective path forward needs to be guided by a deep understanding of the Earth system and a clear sense of our place in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee’s research seeks to understand the Earth system’s response to past climate changes. Using geochemical analysis and uranium-series dating, McGee and his group investigate stalagmites, ancient lake deposits, and deep-sea sediments from field sites around the world to trace patterns of wind and precipitation, water availability in drylands, and permafrost stability through space and time. Armed with precise chronologies, he aims to shed light on drivers of historical hydroclimatic shifts and provide quantitative tests of climate model performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, McGee has helped shape numerous Institute initiatives focused on environment, climate, and sustainability, including serving on the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium Faculty Steering Committee and the faculty advisory board for the MIT Environment and Sustainability Minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div title="Page 3"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McGee also co-chaired MIT's Climate Education Working Group, one of three working groups established under the Institute's Fast Forward climate action plan. The group identified opportunities to strengthen climate- and sustainability-related education at the Institute, from curricular offerings to experiential learning opportunities and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, the working group hosted&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/envisioning-education-climate-changed-world-0501"&gt;MIT Symposium for Advancing Climate Education&lt;/a&gt;, featuring talks by McGee and others on how colleges and universities can innovate and help students develop the skills, capacities, and perspectives they’ll need to live, lead, and thrive in a world being remade by the accelerating climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David is reimagining MIT undergraduate education to include meaningful collaborations with communities outside of MIT, teaching students that scientific discovery is important, but not always enough to make impact for society,” says van der Hilst. “He will help shape the future of the department with this vital perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the start of his career, McGee has been dedicated to sharing his love of exploration with students. He earned a master’s degree in teaching and spent seven years as a teacher in middle school and high school classrooms before earning his PhD in Earth and environmental sciences from Columbia University. He joined the MIT faculty in 2012, and in 2018 received the Excellence in Mentoring Award from MIT’s Undergraduate Advising and Academic Programming office. In 2015, he became the director of MIT’s Terrascope first-year learning community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David's exemplary teaching in Terrascope comes through his understanding that effective solutions must be found where science intersects with community engagement to forge ethical paths forward,” adds van der Hilst. In 2023, for his work with Terrascope, McGee received the school’s highest award, the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/three-honored-school-science-teaching-prizes-0110"&gt;School of Science Teaching Prize&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, he was named a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/macvicar-faculty-fellows-named-0311"&gt;Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow&lt;/a&gt;, the highest teaching honor at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div title="Page 4"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As associate department head, McGee worked alongside van der Hilst and student leaders to promote EAPS community engagement, improve internal supports and reporting structures, and bolster opportunities for students to pursue advanced degrees and STEM careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Jonathan Mingle | Leaders for Global Operations</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Across a career’s worth of pioneering product designs, Doug Field’s work has shaped the experience of anyone who’s ever used a MacBook Air, ridden a Segway, or driven a Tesla Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his newest project is his most ambitious yet: reinventing the Ford automobile, one of the past century’s most iconic pieces of technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ford’s chief electric vehicle (EV), digital, and design officer, Field is tasked with leading the development of the company’s electric vehicles, while making new software platforms central to all Ford models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bring Ford Motor Co. into that digital and electric future, Field effectively has to lead a fast-moving startup inside the legacy carmaker. “It is incredibly hard, figuring out how to do ‘startups’ within large organizations,” he concedes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anyone can pull it off, it’s likely to be Field. Ever since his time in MIT’s Leaders for Global Operations (then known as “Leaders in Manufacturing”) program studying organizational behavior and strategy, Field has been fixated on creating the conditions that foster innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The natural state of an organization is to make it harder and harder to do those things: to innovate, to have small teams, to go against the grain,” he says. To overcome those forces, Field has become a master practitioner of the art of curating diverse, talented teams and helping them flourish inside of big, complex companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one thing to make a creative environment where you can come up with big ideas,” he says. “It’s another to create an execution-focused environment to crank things out. I became intrigued with, and have been for the rest of my career, this question of how can you have both work together?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three decades after his first stint as a development engineer at Ford Motor Co., Field now has a chance to marry the manufacturing muscle of Ford with the bold approach that helped him rethink Apple’s laptops and craft Tesla’s Model 3 sedan. His task is nothing less than rethinking how cars are made and operated, from the bottom up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it’s only creative or execution, you’re not going to change the world,” he says. “If you want to have a huge impact, you need people to change the course you’re on, and you need people to build it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A passion for design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Field had a fascination with automobiles. “I was definitely into cars and transportation more generally,” he says. “I thought of cars as the place where technology and art and human design came together — cars were where all my interests intersected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a mother who was an artist and musician and an engineer father, Field credits his parents’ influence for his lifelong interest in both the aesthetic and technical elements of product design. “I think that’s why I’m drawn to autos — there’s very much an aesthetic aspect to the product,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning a degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University, Field took a job at Ford in 1987. The big Detroit automakers of that era excelled at mass-producing cars, but weren’t necessarily set up to encourage or reward innovative thinking. Field chafed at the “overstructured and bureaucratic” operational culture he encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience was frustrating at times, but&amp;nbsp;also valuable and clarifying. He realized that he “wanted to work with fast-moving, technology-based businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My interest in advancing technical problem-solving didn’t have a place in the auto industry” at the time, he says. “I knew I wanted to work with passionate people and create something that didn’t exist, in an environment where talent and innovation were prized, where irreverence was an asset and not a liability. When I read about Silicon Valley, I loved the way they talked about things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, Field took two years off to enroll in MIT’s LGO program, where he deepened his technical skills and encountered ideas about manufacturing processes and team-driven innovation that would serve him well in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of core skill sets that I developed there were really, really important,” he says, “in the context of production lines and production processes.” He studied systems engineering and the use of Monte Carlo simulations to model complex manufacturing environments. During his internship with aerospace manufacturer Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney, he worked on automated design in computer-aided design (CAD) systems, long before those techniques became standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another powerful tool he picked up was the science of probability and statistics, under the tutelage of MIT Professor Alvin Drake in his legendary course 6.041/6.431 (Probabilistic Systems Analysis). Field would go on to apply those insights not only to production processes, but also to characterizing variability in people’s aptitudes, working styles, and talents, in the service of building better, more innovative teams. And studying organizational strategy catalyzed his career-long interest in “ways to look at innovation as an outcome, rather than a random spark of genius.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many things I was lucky to be exposed to at MIT,” Field says, were “all building blocks, pieces of the puzzle, that helped me navigate through difficult situations later on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning while leading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After leaving Ford in 1993, Field worked at Johnson and Johnson Medical for three years in process development. There, he met Segway inventor Dean Kamen, who was working on a project called the iBOT, a gyroscopic powered wheelchair that could climb stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kamen spun off Segway to develop a new personal mobility device using the same technology, Field became his first hire. He spent nearly a decade as the firm’s chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Segway, Field’s interests in vehicles, technology, innovation, process, and human-centered design all came together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I think about working now on electric cars, it was a real gift,” he says. The problems they tackled prefigured the ones he would grapple with later at Tesla and Ford. “Segway was very much a precursor to a modern EV. Completely software controlled, with higher-voltage batteries, redundant systems, traction control, brushless DC motors — it was basically a miniature Tesla in the year 2000.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Segway, Field assembled an “amazing” team of engineers and designers who were as passionate as he was about pushing the envelope.&amp;nbsp;“Segway was the first place I was able to hand-pick every single person I worked with, define the culture, and define the mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he grew into this leadership role, he became equally engrossed with cracking another puzzle: “How do you prize people who don’t fit in?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such a fundamental part of the fabric of Silicon Valley is the love of embracing talent over a traditional organization’s ways of measuring people,” he says. “If you want to innovate, you need to learn how to manage neurodivergence and a very different set of personalities than the people you find in large corporations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field still keeps the base housing of a Segway in his office, as a reminder of what those kinds of teams — along with obsessive attention to detail — can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Apple in 2008, he showed that component, with its clean lines and every minuscule part in its place in one unified package, to his prospective new colleagues. “They were like, “OK, you’re one of us,’” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon became vice president of hardware development for all Mac computers, leading the teams behind the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and eventually overseeing more than 2,000 employees.&amp;nbsp;“Making things really simple and really elegant, thinking about the product as an integrated whole, that really took me into Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of giving the MacBook Air its signature sleek and light profile is an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MacBook Air was the first high-volume consumer electronic product built out of a CNC-machined enclosure,” says Field. He worked with industrial design and technology teams to devise a way to make the laptop from one solid piece of aluminum and jettison two-thirds of the parts found in the iMac. “We had material cut away so that every single screw and piece of electronics sat down into it an integrated way. That’s how we got the product so small and slim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I interviewed with Jony Ive” — Apple’s legendary chief design officer — “he said your ability to zoom out and zoom in was the number one most important ability as a leader at Apple.” That meant zooming out to think about “the entire ethos of this product, and the way it will affect the world” and zooming all the way back in to obsess over, say, the physical shape of the laptop itself and what it feels like in a user’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That thread of attention to detail, passion for product, design plus technology rolled directly into what I was doing at Tesla,” he says. When Field joined Tesla in 2013, he was drawn to the way the brash startup upended the approach to making cars. “Tesla was integrating digital technology into cars in a way nobody else was. They said, ‘We’re not a car company in Silicon Valley, we’re a Silicon Valley company and we happen to make cars.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field assembled and led the team that produced the Model 3 sedan, Tesla’s most affordable vehicle, designed to have mass-market appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience only reinforced the importance, and power, of zooming in and out as a designer — in a way that encompasses the bigger human resources picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to have a broad sense of what you’re trying to accomplish and help people in the organization understand what it means to them,” he says. “You have to go across and understand operations enough to glue all of those (things) together — while still being great at and focused on something very, very deeply. That’s T-shaped leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He credits his time at LGO with providing the foundation for the “T-shaped leadership” he practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An education like the one I got at MIT allowed me to keep moving that ‘T’, to focus really deep, learn a ton, teach as much as I can, and after something gets more mature, pull out and bed down into other areas where the organization needs to grow or where there’s a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of marrying scale to a “startup mentality”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Field returned to Apple as a vice president for special projects. “I left Tesla after Model 3 and Y started to ramp, as there were people better than me to run high-volume manufacturing,” he says. “I went back to Apple hoping what Tesla had learned would motivate Apple to get into a different market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That market was his early love: cars. Field quietly led a project to develop an electric vehicle at Apple for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Ford CEO Jim Farley came calling. He persuaded Field to return to Ford in late 2021, partly by demonstrating how much things had changed since his first stint as the carmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two things came through loud and clear,” Field says. “One was humility. ‘Our success is not assured.’” That attitude was strikingly different from Field’s early experience in Detroit, encountering managers who were resistant to change. “The other thing was urgency. Jim and Bill Ford said the exact same thing to me: ‘We have four or five years to completely remake this company.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘OK, if the top of company really believes that, then the auto industry may be ready for what I hope to offer.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Field is energized and encouraged by the appetite for reinvention he’s encountered this time around at Ford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can combine what Ford does really well with what a Tesla or Rivian can do well, this is something to be reckoned with,” says Field. “Skunk works have become one of the fundamental tools of my career,” he says, using an industry term that describes a project pursued by a small, autonomous group of people within a larger organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford has been developing a new, lower-cost, software-enabled EV platform — running all of the car’s sensors and components from a central digital operating system — with a “skunk works” team for the past two years. The company plans to build new sedans, SUVs, and small pickups based on this new platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With other legacy carmakers like Volvo racing into the electric future and fierce competition from EV leaders Tesla and Rivian, Field and his colleagues have their work cut out for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he succeeds, leveraging his decades of learning and leading from LGO to Silicon Valley, then his latest chapter could transform the way we all drive — and secure a spot for Ford at the front of the electric vehicle pack in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been lucky to feel over and over that what I’m doing right now — they are going to write a book about it,” say Field. “This is a big deal, for Ford and the U.S. auto industry, and for American industry, actually.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to water use, most of us think of the water we drink. But industrial uses for things like manufacturing account for billions of gallons of water each day. For instance, making a single iPhone, by &lt;a href="https://watercalculator.org/footprint/the-hidden-water-in-everyday-products/#:~:text=When%20the%20water%20required%20for,is%20an%20estimated%203%2C190%20gallons."&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, requires more than 3,000 gallons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gradiant is working to reduce the world’s industrial water footprint. Founded by a team from MIT, Gradiant offers water recycling, treatment, and purification solutions to some of the largest companies on Earth, including Coca Cola, Tesla, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. By serving as an end-to-end water company, Gradiant says it helps companies reuse 2 billion gallons of water&amp;nbsp;each day and saves another 2 billion gallons&amp;nbsp;of fresh water from being withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s mission is to preserve water for generations to come in the face of rising global demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We work on both ends of the water spectrum,” Gradiant co-founder and CEO Anurag Bajpayee SM ’08, PhD ’12 says. “We work with ultracontaminated water, and we can also provide ultrapure water for use in areas like chip fabrication. Our specialty is in the extreme water challenges that can’t be solved with traditional technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each customer, Gradiant builds tailored water treatment solutions that combine chemical treatments with membrane filtration and biological process technologies, leveraging a portfolio of patents to drastically cut water usage and waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before Gradiant, 40 million liters of water would be used in the chip-making process. It would all be contaminated and treated, and maybe 30 percent would be reused,” explains Gradiant co-founder and COO Prakash Govindan PhD ’12. “We have the technology to recycle, in some cases, 99 percent of the water. Now, instead of consuming 40 million liters, chipmakers only need to consume 400,000 liters, which is a huge shift in the water footprint of that industry. And this is not just with semiconductors. We’ve done this in food and beverage, we’ve done this in renewable energy, we’ve done this in pharmaceutical drug production, and several other areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning the value of water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Govindan grew up in a part of India that experienced a years-long drought beginning when he was 10. Without tap water, one of Govindan’s chores was to haul water up the stairs of his apartment complex each time a truck delivered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However much water my brother and I could carry was how much we had for the week,” Govindan recalls. “I learned the value of water the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Govindan attended the Indian Institute of Technology as an undergraduate, and when he came to MIT for his PhD, he sought out the groups working on water challenges. He began working on a water treatment method called carrier gas extraction for his PhD under Gradiant co-founder and MIT Professor John Lienhard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bajpayee also worked on water treatment methods at MIT, and the pair worked with the Deshpande Center to derisk their technologies. After brief stints as postdocs at MIT, the researchers licensed their work and founded Gradiant in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrier gas extraction became Gradiant’s first proprietary technology. The founders began by treating wastewater created by oil and gas wells, landing their first partner in a Texas company. But Gradiant gradually expanded to solving water challenges in power generation, mining, textiles, and refineries. Then the founders noticed opportunities in industries like electronics, semiconductors, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals. Today, oil and gas wastewater treatment makes up a small percentage of Gradiant’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the company expanded, it added technologies to its portfolio, patenting new water treatment methods around reverse osmosis, selective contaminant extraction, and free radical oxidation. Gradiant has also created a digital system that uses AI to measure, predict, and control water treatment facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The advantage Gradiant has over every other water company is that R&amp;amp;D is in our DNA,” Govindan says, noting Gradiant has a world-class research lab at its headquarters in Boston. “At MIT, we learned how to do cutting-edge technology development, and we never let go of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders compare their suite of technologies to LEGO bricks they can mix and match depending on a customer’s water needs. Gradiant has built more than 2,500 of these end-to-end systems for customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our customers aren’t water companies; they are industrial clients like semiconductor manufacturers, drug companies, and food and beverage companies,” Bajpayee says. “They aren’t about to start operating a water treatment plant. They look at us as their water partner who can take care of the whole water problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuing innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders say Gradiant has been roughly doubling its revenue each year over the last five years, and it’s continuing to add technologies to its platform. For instance, Gradiant recently developed a critical minerals recovery solution to extract materials like lithium and nickel from customers’ wastewater, which could expand access to critical materials essential to the production of batteries and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can extract lithium from brine water in an environmentally and economically feasible way, the U.S. can meet all of its lithium needs from within the U.S.,” Bajpayee says. “What’s preventing large-scale extraction of lithium from brine is technology, and we believe what we have now deployed will open the floodgates for direct lithium extraction and completely revolutionized the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has also validated a method for eliminating PFAS —&amp;nbsp;so-called toxic “forever chemicals” — in a pilot project with a leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer.&amp;nbsp;In the near future, it hopes to bring that solution to municipal water treatment plants to protect cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Gradiant’s innovation is the founders’ belief that industrial activity doesn’t have to deplete one of the world’s most vital resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ever since the industrial revolution, we’ve been taking from nature,” Bajpayee says. “By treating and recycling water, by reducing water consumption and making industry highly water efficient, we have this unique opportunity to turn the clock back and give nature water back. If that’s your driver, you can’t choose not to innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last year the Earth exceeded &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/2024-track-be-first-year-exceed-15oc-above-pre-industrial-average" target="_blank"&gt;1.5 degrees Celsius&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of warming above preindustrial times, a threshold beyond which wildfires, droughts, floods, and other climate impacts are expected to escalate in frequency, intensity, and lethality. To cap global warming at 1.5 C and avert that scenario, the nearly 200 signatory nations of the &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt; on climate change will &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_TechnicalSummary.pdf#page=69"&gt;need to not only dramatically lower their greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;, but also take measures to remove carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere and durably store it at or below the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past analyses of the climate mitigation potential, costs, benefits, and drawbacks of different &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/outreach/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_Factsheet_CDR.pdf"&gt;carbon dioxide removal&lt;/a&gt; (CDR) options have focused primarily on three strategies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing plant matter is converted into fuels or directly burned to generate energy, with some of the plant’s carbon content captured and then stored safely and permanently; afforestation/reforestation, in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-absorbing trees are planted in large numbers; and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), a technology that captures and separates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from ambient air, and injects it into geological reservoirs or incorporates it into durable products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a more comprehensive and actionable analysis of CDR, a new study by researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (CS3) first expands the option set to include biochar (charcoal produced from plant matter and stored in soil) and enhanced weathering (EW) (spreading finely ground rock particles on land to accelerate storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in soil and water). The study then evaluates portfolios of all five options — in isolation and in combination — to assess their capability to meet the 1.5 C goal, and their potential impacts on land, energy, and policy costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ada4c0"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Letters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Aided by their global multi-region, multi-sector Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, the MIT CS3 researchers produce three key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the most cost-effective, low-impact strategy that policymakers can take to achieve global net-zero emissions — an essential step in meeting the 1.5 C goal — is to diversify their CDR portfolio, rather than rely on any single option. This approach minimizes overall cropland and energy consumption, and negative impacts such as increased food insecurity and decreased energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By diversifying across multiple CDR options, the highest CDR deployment of around 31.5 gigatons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per year is achieved in 2100, while also proving the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. The study identifies BECCS and biochar as most cost-competitive in removing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, followed by EW, with DACCS as uncompetitive due to high capital and energy requirements. While posing logistical and other challenges, biochar and EW have the potential to improve soil quality and productivity across 45 percent of all croplands by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diversifying CDR portfolios is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy because it avoids relying on a single CDR option, thereby reducing and redistributing negative impacts on agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, as well as on the energy sector,” says &lt;a href="https://www.carma-chair.com/post-doctoral-program-solene-chiquier"&gt;Solene Chiquier&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the study who was a CS3 postdoc during its preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second finding: There is no optimal CDR portfolio that will work well at global and national levels. The ideal CDR portfolio for a particular region will depend on local technological, economic, and geophysical conditions. For example, afforestation and reforestation would be of great benefit in places like Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, by not only sequestering carbon in more acreage of protected forest but also helping to preserve planetary well-being and human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In designing a sustainable, cost-effective CDR portfolio, it is important to account for regional availability of agricultural, energy, and carbon-storage resources,” says &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey"&gt;Sergey Paltsev&lt;/a&gt;, CS3 deputy director, &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt; senior research scientist, and supervising co-author of the study. “Our study highlights the need for enhancing knowledge about local conditions that favor some CDR options over others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the MIT CS3 researchers show that delaying large-scale deployment of CDR portfolios could be very costly, leading to considerably higher carbon prices across the globe — a development sure to deter the climate mitigation efforts needed to achieve the 1.5 C goal. They recommend near-term implementation of policy and financial incentives to help fast-track those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>MIT Climate and Energy Ventures class spins out entrepreneurs — and successful companies</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-climate-and-energy-ventures-class-0128</link>
  <description><![CDATA[The course challenges students to commercialize technologies and ideas in one whirlwind semester. Alumni of the class have founded more than 150 companies.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2014, a team of MIT students in course 15.366 (Climate and Energy Ventures) developed a plan to commercialize MIT research on how to move information between chips with light instead of electricity, reducing energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the class, which challenges students to identify early customers and pitch their business plan to investors, the team went on to &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/optical-chips-clean-energy-prize-0513"&gt;win both grand prizes&lt;/a&gt; at the MIT Clean Energy Prize. Today the company, Ayar Labs, has raised a total of $370 million from a group including chip leaders AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA, to scale the manufacturing of its optical chip interconnects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayar Labs is one of many companies whose roots can be traced back to 15.366. In fact, more than 150 companies have been founded by alumni of the class since its founding in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the class, student teams select a technology or idea and determine the best path for its commercialization. The semester-long project, which is accompanied by lectures and mentoring, equips students with real-world experience in launching a business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to educate entrepreneurs on how to start companies in the climate and energy space,” says Senior Lecturer Tod Hynes, who co-founded the course and has been teaching since 2008. “We do that through hands-on experience. We require students to engage with customers, talk to potential suppliers, partners, investors, and to practice their pitches to learn from that feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class attracts hundreds of student applications each year. As one of the catalysts for MIT spinoffs, it is also one reason a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/report-entrepreneurial-impact-1209"&gt;2015 report&lt;/a&gt; found that MIT alumni-founded companies had generated roughly $1.9 trillion in annual revenues. If MIT were a country, that figure that would make it the 10th largest economy in the world, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“’Mens et manus’ (‘mind and hand’) is MIT's motto, and the hands-on experience we try to provide in this class is hard to beat,” Hynes says. “When you actually go through the process of commercialization in the real world, you learn more and you’re in a better spot. That experiential learning approach really aligns with MIT’s approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulating a startup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course was started by Bill Aulet, a professor of the practice at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the managing director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship. After serving as an advisor the first year and helping Aulet launch the class, Hynes began teaching the class with Aulet in the fall of 2008. The pair also launched the Climate and Energy Prize around the same time, which continues today and recently received over 150 applications from teams from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A core feature of the class is connecting students in different academic fields. Each year, organizers aim to enroll students with backgrounds in science, engineering, business, and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The class is meant to be accessible to anybody at MIT,” Hynes says, noting the course has also since opened to students from Harvard University. “We’re trying to pull across disciplines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class quickly grew in popularity around campus. Over the last few years, the course has had about 150 students apply for 50 spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I mentioned Climate and Energy Ventures in my application to MIT,” says Chris Johnson, a second-year graduate student in the Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) Program. “Coming into MIT, I was very interested in sustainability, and energy in particular, and also in startups. I had heard great things about the class, and I waited until my last semester to apply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course’s organizers select mostly graduate students, whom they prefer to be in the final year of their program so they can more easily continue working on the venture after the class is finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether or not students stick with the project from the class, it’s a great experience that will serve them in their careers,” says Jennifer Turliuk, the practice leader for climate and energy artificial intelligence at the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship, who helped teach the class this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes describes the course as a venture-building simulation. Before it begins, organizers select up to 30 technologies and ideas that are in the right stage for commercialization. Students can also come into the class with ideas or technologies they want to work on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks of introductions and lectures, students form into multidisciplinary teams of about five and begin going through each of the 24 steps of building a startup described in Aulet’s book “Disciplined Entrepreneurship,” which includes things like engaging with potential early customers, quantifying a value proposition, and establishing a business model. Everything builds toward a one-hour final presentation that’s designed to simulate a pitch to investors or government officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot of work, and because it’s a team-based project, your grade is highly dependent on your team,” Hynes says. “You also get graded by your team; that’s about 10 percent of your grade. We try to encourage people to be proactive and supportive teammates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students say the process is fast-paced but rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely demanding,” says Sofie Netteberg, a graduate student who is also in the LGO program at MIT. “Depending on where you’re at with your technology, you can be moving very quickly. That’s the stage that I was in, which I found really engaging. We basically just had a lab technology, and it was like, ‘What do we do next?’ You also get a ton of support from the professors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the classroom to the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fall’s final presentations took place at the headquarters of the MIT-affiliated venture firm The Engine in front of an audience of professors, investors, members of foundations supporting entrepreneurship, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got to hear feedback from people who would be the real next step for the technology if the startup gets up and running,” said Johnson, whose team was commercializing a method for storing energy in concrete. “That was really valuable. We know that these are not only people we might see in the next month or the next funding rounds, but they’re also exactly the type of people that are going to give us the questions we should be thinking about. It was clarifying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the semester, students treated the project like a real venture they’d be working on well beyond the length of the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one’s really thinking about this class for the grade; it’s about the learning,” says Netteberg, whose team was encouraged to keep working on their electrolyzer technology designed to more efficiently produce green hydrogen. “We’re not stressed about getting an A. If we want to keep working on this, we want real feedback: What do you think we did well? What do we need to keep working on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes says several investors expressed interest in supporting the businesses coming out of the class. Moving forward, he hopes students embrace the test-bed environment his team has created for them and try bold new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have been very pragmatic over the years, which is good, but also potentially limiting,” Hynes says. “This is also an opportunity to do something that’s a little further out there — something that has really big potential impact if it comes together. This is the time where students get to experiment, so why not try something big?”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Buildings cost a lot these days. But when concrete buildings are being constructed, there’s another material that can make them less expensive: mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have developed a method to use lightly treated mud, including soil from a building site, as the “formwork” molds into which concrete is poured. The technique deploys 3D printing and can replace the more costly method of building elaborate wood formworks for concrete construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve demonstrated is that we can essentially take the ground we’re standing on, or waste soil from a construction site, and transform it into accurate, highly complex, and flexible formwork for customized concrete structures,” says Sandy Curth, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Architecture who has helped spearhead the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach could help concrete-based construction take place more quickly and efficiently. It could also reduce costs and carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has the potential for immediate impact and doesn’t require changing the nature of the construction industry,” says Curth, who doubles as director of the &lt;a href="https://programmablemud.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Programmable Mud Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curth has co-authored multiple papers about the method, most recently, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950061824035293" target="_blank"&gt;EarthWorks: Zero waste 3D printed earthen formwork for shape-optimized, reinforced concrete construction&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Construction and Building Materials&lt;/em&gt;. Curth wrote that paper with nine co-authors, including Natalie Pearl, Emily Wissemann, Tim Cousin, Latifa Alkhayat, Vincent Jackow, Keith Lee, and Oliver Moldow, all MIT students; and Mohamed Ismail of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s final two co-authors are Lawrence Sass, professor and chair of the Computation Group in MIT’s Department of Architecture, and Caitlin Mueller, an associate professor at MIT in the Department of Architecture and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Sass is Curth’s graduate advisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a structure once, not twice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructing wooden formwork for a building is costly and time-consuming. There is saying in the industry that concrete structures have to be built twice — once through the wooden formwork, then again in the concrete poured into the forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using soil for the formwork could change that process. While it might seem like an unusual material compared to the solidity of wooden formwork, soil is firm enough to handle poured concrete. The EarthWorks method, as its known, introduces some additive materials, such as straw, and a wax-like coating for the soil material to prevent any water from draining out of the concrete. Using large-scale 3D printing, the researchers can take soil from a construction site and print it into a custom-designed formwork shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve done is make a system where we are using what is largely straightforward, large-scale 3D printing technology, and making it highly functional for the material,” Curth says. “We found a way to make formwork that is infinitely recyclable. It’s just dirt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cost and ease of acquiring the materials, the method offers at least two other interrelated advantages. One is environmental: Concrete construction accounts for as much as 8 percent of global carbon emissions, and this approach supports substantial emissions reductions, both through the formwork material itself and the ease of shaping the resulting concrete to only use what is structurally required.&amp;nbsp;Using a method called shape optimization, developed for reinforced concrete in previous research by Ismail and Mueller, it is possible to reduce the carbon emissions of concrete structural frames by more than 50 percent. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The EarthWorks technique brings these complex, optimized structures much closer to built reality by offering a low-cost, low-carbon fabrication technique for formwork that can be deployed anywhere in the world,” Mueller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an enabling technology to make reinforced concrete buildings much, much more materially efficient, which has a direct impact on global carbon emissions,” Curth adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, the EarthWorks method allows architects and engineers to create customized concrete shapes more easily, due to the flexibility of the formwork material. It is easier to cast concrete in an unusual shape when molding it with soil, not wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s cool here is we’re able to make shape-optimized building elements for the same amount of time and energy it would take to make rectilinear building elements,” Curth says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Curth notes, the projects developed by the Programmable Mud group are highly collaborative. He emphasizes the roles played by both Sass, a leader in using computation to help develop low-cost housing, and Mueller, whose work also deploys new computational methods to assess innovative structural ideas in architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concrete is a wonderful material when it is used thoughtfully and efficiently, which is inherently connected to how it is shaped,” Mueller says. “However, the minimal forms that emerge from optimization are at odds with conventional construction logics. It is very exciting to advance a technique that subverts this supposed tradeoff, showing that performance-driven complexity can be achieved with low carbon emissions and low cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While finishing his doctorate at MIT, Curth has also founded a firm, FORMA Systems, through which he hopes to take the EarthWorks method into the construction industry. Using this approach does mean builders would need to have a large 3D printer on-site. However, they would also save significantly on materials costs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further in the future, Curth envisions a time when the method could be used not just for formworks, but to construct templates for, say, two-story residential building made entirely out of earth. Of course, some parts of the world, including the U.S., extensively use adobe architecture already, but the idea here would be to systematize the production of such homes and make them inexpensive in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In either case, Curth says, as formwork for concrete or by itself, we now have new ways to apply soil to construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have built with earth for as long as we’ve had buildings, but given contemporary demands for urban concrete buildings, this approach basically decouples cost from complexity,” Curth says. “I guarantee you we can start to make higher-performance buildings for less money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project &amp;nbsp;was supported by the Sidara Urban Research Seed Fund administered by MIT’s Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism, and by lyndaLABS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the residents of a manufactured-home neighborhood in southeast suburban Houston, not far from the Buffalo Bayou, took a major step in dealing with climate problems: They bought the land under their homes. Then they installed better drainage and developed strategies to share expertise and tools for home repairs. The result? The neighborhood made it through Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and a winter freeze in 2021 without major damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood is part of a U.S. movement toward the Resident Owned Community (ROC) model for manufactured home parks. Many people in manufactured homes — mobile homes — do not own the land under them. But if the residents of a manufactured-home park can form an ROC, they can take action to adapt to climate risks — and ease the threat of eviction. With an ROC, manufactured-home residents can be there to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That speaks to a larger issue: In cities, lower-income residents are often especially vulnerable to natural hazards, such as flooding, extreme heat, and wildfire. But efforts aimed at helping cities as a whole withstand these disasters can lead to interventions that displace already-disadvantaged residents — by turning a low-lying neighborhood into a storm buffer, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The global climate crisis has very differential effects on cities, and neighborhoods within cities,” says Lawrence Vale, a professor of urban studies at MIT and co-author of a new book on the subject, “&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262549868/the-equitably-resilient-city/" target="_blank"&gt;The Equitably Resilient City&lt;/a&gt;,” published by the MIT Press and co-authored with Zachary B. Lamb PhD ’18, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the book, the scholars delve into 12 case studies from around the globe which, they believe, have it both ways: Low- and middle-income communities have driven climate progress through tangible built projects, while also keeping people from being displaced, and indeed helping them participate in local governance and neighborhood decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can either dive into despair about climate issues, or think they’re solvable and ask what it takes to succeed in a more equitable way,” says Vale, who is the Ford Professor of Urban Design and Planning at MIT. “This book is asking how people look at problems more holistically — to show how environmental impacts are integrated with their livelihoods, with feeling they can have security from displacement, and feeling they’re not going to be displaced, with being empowered to share in the governance where they live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lamb notes, “Pursuing equitable urban climate adaptation requires both changes in the physical built environment of cities and innovations in institutions and governance practices to address deep-seated causes of inequality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twelve projects, four elements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research for “The Equitably Resilient City” began with exploration of about 200 potential cases, and ultimately focused on 12 projects from around the globe, including the U.S., Brazil, Thailand, and France. Vale and Lamb, coordinating with locally-based research teams, visited these diverse sites and conducted interviews in nine languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 12 projects work on multiple levels at once: They are steps toward environmental progress that also help local communities in civic and economic terms. The book uses the acronym LEGS (“livelihood, environment, governance, and security”) to encapsulate this need to make equitable progress on four different fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing one of those things well is worth recognition, and doing all of them well is exciting,” Vale says. “It’s important to understand not just what these communities did, but how they did it and whose views were involved. These 12 cases are not a random sample. The book looks for people who are partially succeeding at difficult things in difficult circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One case study is set in São Paolo, Brazil, where low-income residents of a hilly favela benefitted from new housing in the area on undeveloped land that is less prone to slides. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, residents of low-lying neighborhoods abutting a water channel formed a durable set of community groups to create a fairer solution to flooding:&amp;nbsp;Although the channel needed to be re-widened, the local coalition insisted on limiting displacement, supporting local livelihoods and improving environmental conditions and public space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a backlash to older practices,” Vale says, referring to the large-scale urban planning and infrastructure projects of the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, which often ignored community input. “People saw what happened during the urban renewal era and said, ‘You’re not going to do that to us again.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one through-line in “The Equitably Resilient City” is that cities, like all places, can be contested political terrain. Often, solid solutions emerge when local groups organize, advocate for new solutions, and eventually gain enough traction to enact them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every one of our examples and cases has probably 15 or 20 years of activity behind it, as well as engagements with a much deeper history,” Vale says. “They’re all rooted in a very often troubled [political] context. And yet these are places that have made progress possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think locally, adapt anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another motif of “The Equitably Resilient City” is that local progress matters greatly, for a few reasons — including the value of having communities develop projects that meet their own needs, based on their input. Vale and Lamb are interested in projects even if they are very small-scale, and devote one chapter of the book to the Paris OASIS program, which has developed a series of cleverly designed, heavily tree-dotted school playgrounds across Paris. These projects&amp;nbsp;provide environmental education opportunities and help mitigate flooding and urban heat while adding CO2-harnessing greenery to the cityscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual park, by itself, can only do so much, but the concept behind it can be adopted by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This book is mostly centered on local projects rather than national schemes,” Vale says. “The hope is they serve as an inspiration for people to adapt to their own situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, the urban geography and governance of places such as Paris or São Paulo will differ widely. But efforts to make improvements to public open space or to well-located inexpensive housing stock applies in cities across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the authors devote a chapter to work in the Cully neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, where community leaders have instituted a raft of urban environmental improvements while creating and preserving more affordable housing. The idea in the Cully area, as in all these cases, is to make places more resistant to climate change while enhancing them as good places to live for those already there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Climate adaptation is going to mobilize enormous public and private resources to reshape cities across the globe,” Lamb notes. “These cases suggest pathways where those resources can make cities both more resilient in the face of climate change and more equitable. In fact, these projects show how making cities more equitable can be part of making them more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scholars have praised the book. Eric Klinenberg, director of New York University’s Institute for Public Knowledge has called it “at once scholarly, constructive, and uplifting, a reminder that better, more just cities remain within our reach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vale also teaches some of the book’s concepts in his classes, finding that MIT students, wherever they are from, enjoy the idea of thinking creatively about climate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, students want to find ways of applying technical skills to urgent global challenges,” Vale says. “I do think there are many opportunities, especially at a time of climate crisis. We try to highlight some of the solutions that are out there. Give us an opportunity, and we’ll show you what a place can be.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A platform to expedite clean energy projects</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Station A, founded by MIT alumni, makes the process of buying clean energy simple for property owners.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Businesses and developers often face a steep learning curve when installing clean energy technologies, such as solar installations and EV chargers. To get a fair deal, they need to navigate a complex bidding process that involves requesting proposals, evaluating bids, and ultimately contracting with a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the startup Station A, founded by a pair of MIT alumni and their colleagues, is streamlining the process of deploying clean energy. The company has developed a marketplace for clean energy that helps real estate owners and businesses analyze properties to calculate returns on clean energy projects, create detailed project listings, collect and compare bids, and select a provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform helps real estate owners and businesses adopt clean energy technologies like solar panels, batteries, and EV chargers at the lowest possible prices, in places with the highest potential to reduce energy costs and emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do a lot to make adopting clean energy simple,” explains Manos Saratsis SMArchS ’15, who co-founded Station A with Kevin Berkemeyer MBA ’14. “Imagine if you were trying to buy a plane ticket and your travel agent only used one carrier. It would be more expensive, and you couldn’t even get to some places. Our customers want to have multiple options and easily learn about the track record of whoever they’re working with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Station A has already partnered with some of the largest real estate companies in the country, some with thousands of properties, to reduce the carbon footprint of their buildings. The company is also working with grocery chains, warehouses, and other businesses to accelerate the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform uses a lot of AI and machine learning to turn addresses into building footprints and to understand their electricity costs, available incentives, and where they can expect the highest ROI,” says Saratsis, who serves as Station A’s head of product. “This would normally require tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of consulting time, and we can do it for next to no money very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student in MIT’s Department of Architecture, Saratsis studied environmental design modeling, using data from sources like satellite imagery to understand how communities consume energy and to propose the most impactful potential clean energy solutions. He says classes with professors &lt;a href="https://architecture.mit.edu/people/christoph-reinhart" target="_blank"&gt;Christoph Reinhart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/kll/overview/" target="_blank"&gt;Kent Larson&lt;/a&gt; were particularly eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My ability to build a thermal energy model and simulate electricity usage in a building started at MIT,” Saratsis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkemeyer served as president of the MIT Energy Club while at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He was also a research assistant at the MIT Energy Initiative as part of the &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/research/future-solar-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;Future of Solar&lt;/a&gt; report and a teacher’s assistant for course 15.366 (Climate and Energy Ventures). He says classes in entrepreneurship with professor of the practice Bill Aulet and in sustainability with Senior Lecturer Jason Jay were formative. Prior to his studies at MIT, Berkemeyer had extensive experience developing solar and storage projects and selling clean energy products to commercial customers. The eventual co-founders didn’t cross paths at MIT, but they ended up working together at the utility NRG Energy after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As co-founders, we saw an opportunity to transform how businesses approach clean energy,” said Berkemeyer, who is now Station A’s CEO. “Station A was born out of a shared belief that data and transparency could unlock the full potential of clean energy technologies for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At NRG, the founders built software to help identify decarbonization opportunities for customers without having to send analysts to the sites for in-person audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they worked with a big grocery chain or a big retailer, we would use proprietary analytics to evaluate that portfolio and come up with recommendations for things like solar projects, energy efficiency, and demand response that would yield positive returns within a year,” Saratsis explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tools were a huge success within the company. In 2018, the pair, along with co-founders Jeremy Lucas and Sam Steyer, decided to spin out the technology into Station A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders started by working with energy companies but soon shifted their focus to real estate owners with huge portfolios and large businesses with long-term leasing contracts. Many customers have hundreds or even thousands of addresses to evaluate. Using just the addresses, Station A can provide detailed financial return estimates for clean energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the company widened its focus from selling access to its analytics to creating a marketplace for clean energy transactions, helping businesses run the competitive bidding process for clean energy projects. After a project is installed, Station A can also evaluate whether it’s achieving its expected performance and track financial returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I talk to people outside the industry, they’re like, ‘Wait, this doesn’t exist already?’” Saratsis says. “It’s kind of crazy, but the industry is still very nascent, and no one’s been able to figure out a way to run the bidding process transparently and at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the campus to the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 2,500 clean energy developers are active on Station A’s platform. A number of large real estate investment trusts also use its services, in addition to businesses like HP, Nestle, and Goldman Sachs. If Station A were a developer, Saratsis says it would now rank in the top 10 in terms of annual solar deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders credit their time at MIT with helping them scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these relationships originated within the MIT network, whether through folks we met at Sloan or through engagement with MIT,” Saratsis says. “So much of this business is about reputation, and we’ve established a really good reputation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding, Station A has also been sponsoring classes at the Sustainability Lab at MIT, where Saratsis conducted research as a student. As they work to grow Station A’s offerings, the founders say they use the skills they gained as students every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything we do around building analysis is inspired in some ways by the stuff that I did when I was at MIT,” Saratsis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Station A is just getting started,” Berkemeyer says. “Clean energy adoption isn’t just about technology — it’s about making the process seamless and accessible. That’s what drives us every day, and we’re excited to lead this transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Toward sustainable decarbonization of aviation in Latin America</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Special report describes targets for advancing technologically feasible and economically viable strategies.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and aviation emissions are expected to double by mid-century as demand for domestic and international air travel rises. To sharply reduce emissions in alignment with the &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;’s long-term goal to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/sustainability/flynetzero/"&gt;has set a goal&lt;/a&gt; to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Which raises the question: Are there technologically feasible and economically viable strategies to reach that goal within the next 25 years?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin to address that question, a team of researchers at the &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (CS3) and the &lt;a href="https://lae.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the Environment&lt;/a&gt; has spent the past year analyzing aviation decarbonization options in Latin America, where air travel is expected to more than triple by 2050 and thereby double today’s aviation-related emissions in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief among those options is the development and deployment of &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/sustainability/sustainable-aviation-fuels/"&gt;sustainable aviation fuel&lt;/a&gt;. Currently produced from low- and zero-carbon sources (feedstock) including municipal waste and non-food crops, and requiring practically no alteration of aircraft systems or refueling infrastructure, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has the potential to perform just as well as petroleum-based jet fuel with &lt;a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/sustainability/sustainable-aviation-fuels/"&gt;as low as 20 percent of its carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused on Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru, the researchers assessed SAF feedstock availability, the costs of corresponding SAF pathways, and how SAF deployment would likely impact fuel use, prices, emissions, and aviation demand in each country. They also explored how efficiency improvements and market-based mechanisms could help the region to reach decarbonization targets. The team’s findings appear in a &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/publication/118414"&gt;CS3 Special Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAF emissions, costs, and sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under an&amp;nbsp;ambitious emissions mitigation scenario designed to cap global warming at 1.5 C and raise the rate of SAF use in Latin America to 65 percent by 2050, the researchers projected&amp;nbsp;aviation emissions to be reduced by about 60 percent in 2050 compared to a scenario in which existing climate policies are not strengthened. To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, other measures would be required,&amp;nbsp;such as improvements in operational and air traffic efficiencies, airplane fleet renewal, alternative forms of propulsion, and carbon offsets and removals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, jet fuel prices in Latin America&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;are around $0.70 per liter. Based on the current&amp;nbsp;availability of feedstocks, the researchers projected&amp;nbsp;SAF costs within the six countries&amp;nbsp;studied to range from $1.11 to $2.86 per liter. They cautioned that increased fuel prices could affect operating costs&amp;nbsp;of the aviation sector and overall aviation demand unless strategies to&amp;nbsp;manage price increases are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the 1.5 C scenario, the total cumulative&amp;nbsp;capital investments required to build new SAF producing plants&amp;nbsp;between 2025 and 2050 were estimated at $204 billion for the six countries (ranging from $5 billion in Ecuador to $84 billion in Brazil). The researchers identified sugarcane- and corn-based ethanol-to-jet fuel, palm oil- and soybean-based hydro-processed esters and fatty acids as the most promising feedstock sources in the near term for SAF production in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that SAF offers a significant decarbonization pathway, which must be combined with an economy-wide emissions mitigation policy that uses market-based mechanisms to offset the remaining emissions,” says &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/paltsev-sergey"&gt;Sergey Paltsev&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the report, MIT CS3 deputy director, and senior research scientist at the &lt;a href="https://energy.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Energy Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded the report with recommendations for national policymakers and aviation industry leaders in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stressed that government policy and regulatory mechanisms will be needed&amp;nbsp;to create sufficient conditions to attract SAF investments in the region and make&amp;nbsp;SAF commercially viable as the aviation industry decarbonizes operations. Without appropriate policy frameworks, SAF requirements will affect the cost of air travel. For&amp;nbsp;fuel producers, stable, long-term-oriented policies and regulations&amp;nbsp;will be needed to create&amp;nbsp;robust supply chains, build demand for establishing&amp;nbsp;economies of scale, and develop&amp;nbsp;innovative pathways for producing SAF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the research team recommended a region-wide collaboration in designing SAF policies. A unified decarbonization strategy among all countries in the region will help ensure&amp;nbsp;competitiveness, economies of scale, and&amp;nbsp;achievement of long-term carbon emissions-reduction goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regional feedstock availability and costs make Latin America a potential major player in SAF production,” says &lt;a href="https://cs3.mit.edu/about-us/personnel/gurgel-angelo"&gt;Angelo Gurgel&lt;/a&gt;, a principal research scientist at MIT CS3 and co-author of the study. “SAF requirements, combined with government support mechanisms, will ensure sustainable decarbonization while enhancing the region’s connectivity and the ability of disadvantaged communities to access air transport.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial support for this study was provided by LATAM Airlines and Airbus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence has become vital in business and financial dealings, medical care, technology development, research, and much more. Without realizing it, consumers rely on AI when they stream a video, do online banking, or perform an online search. Behind these capabilities are more than 10,000 data centers globally, each one a huge warehouse containing thousands of computer servers and other infrastructure for storing, managing, and processing data. There are now over 5,000 data centers in the United States, and new ones are being built every day — in the U.S. and worldwide. Often dozens are clustered together right near where people live, attracted by policies that provide tax breaks and other incentives, and by what looks like abundant electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And data centers do consume huge amounts of electricity.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;U.S. data centers consumed more than 4 percent of the country’s total electricity in 2023, and by 2030 that fraction could rise to 9 percent, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. A single large data center can consume as much electricity as 50,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden need for so many data centers presents a massive challenge to the technology and energy industries, government policymakers, and everyday consumers. Research scientists and faculty members at the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) are exploring multiple facets of this problem — from sourcing power to grid improvement to analytical tools that increase efficiency, and more. Data centers have quickly become the energy issue of our day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected demand brings unexpected solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;companies that use data centers to provide cloud computing and data management services are announcing some surprising steps to deliver all that electricity. Proposals include building their own small nuclear plants near their data centers and even restarting one of the undamaged nuclear reactors at Three Mile Island, which has been shuttered since 2019. (A different reactor at that plant partially melted down in 1979, causing the nation’s worst nuclear power accident.) Already the need to power AI is causing delays in the planned shutdown of some coal-fired power plants and raising prices for residential consumers. Meeting the needs of data centers is not only stressing power grids, but also setting back the transition to clean energy needed to stop climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many aspects to the data center problem from a power perspective. Here are some that MIT researchers are focusing on, and why they’re important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unprecedented surge in the demand for electricity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the past, computing was not a significant user of electricity,” says William H. Green, director of MITEI and the Hoyt C. Hottel Professor in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. “Electricity was used for running industrial processes and powering household devices such as air conditioners and lights, and more recently for powering heat pumps and charging electric cars. But now all of a sudden, electricity used for computing in general, and by data centers in particular, is becoming a gigantic new demand that no one anticipated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the lack of foresight? Usually, demand for electric power increases by roughly half-a-percent per year, and utilities bring in new power generators and make other investments as needed to meet the expected new demand. But the data centers now coming online are creating unprecedented leaps in demand that operators didn’t see coming. In addition, the new demand is constant. It’s critical that a data center provides its services all day, every day. There can be no interruptions in processing large datasets, accessing stored data, and running the cooling equipment needed to keep all the packed-together computers churning away without overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even if enough electricity is generated, getting it to where it’s needed may be a problem, explains Deepjyoti Deka, a MITEI research scientist. “A grid is a network-wide operation, and the grid operator may have sufficient generation at another location or even elsewhere in the country, but the wires may not have sufficient capacity to carry the electricity to where it’s wanted.” So transmission capacity must be expanded — and, says Deka, that’s a slow process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the “interconnection queue.” Sometimes, adding either a new user (a “load”) or a new generator to an existing grid can cause instabilities or other problems for everyone else already on the grid. In that situation, bringing a new data center online may be delayed. Enough delays can result in new loads or generators having to stand in line and wait for their turn. Right now, much of the interconnection queue is already filled up with new solar and wind projects. The delay is now about five years. Meeting the demand from newly installed data centers while ensuring that the quality of service elsewhere is not hampered is a problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding clean electricity sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further complicate the challenge, many companies — including so-called “hyperscalers” such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon — have made public commitments to having net-zero carbon emissions within the next 10 years. Many have been making strides toward achieving their clean-energy goals by buying “power purchase agreements.” They sign a contract to buy electricity from, say, a solar or wind facility, sometimes providing funding for the facility to be built. But that approach to accessing clean energy has its limits when faced with the extreme electricity demand of a data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, soaring power consumption is delaying coal plant closures in many states. There are simply not enough sources of renewable energy to serve both the hyperscalers and the existing users, including individual consumers. As a result, conventional plants fired by fossil fuels such as coal are needed more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the hyperscalers look for sources of clean energy for their data centers, one option could be to build their own wind and solar installations. But such facilities would generate electricity only intermittently. Given the need for uninterrupted power, the data center would have to maintain energy storage units, which are expensive. They could instead rely on natural gas or diesel generators for backup power — but those devices would need to be coupled with equipment to capture the carbon emissions, plus a nearby site for permanently disposing of the captured carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of such complications, several of the hyperscalers are turning to nuclear power. As Green notes, “Nuclear energy is well matched to the demand of data centers, because nuclear plants can generate lots of power reliably, without interruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a much-publicized move in September, Microsoft signed a deal to buy power for 20 years after Constellation Energy reopens one of the undamaged reactors at its now-shuttered nuclear plant at Three Mile Island, the site of the much-publicized nuclear accident in 1979. If approved by regulators, Constellation will bring that reactor online by 2028, with Microsoft buying all of the power it produces. Amazon also reached a deal to purchase power produced by another nuclear plant threatened with closure due to financial troubles. And in early December, Meta released a request for proposals to identify nuclear energy developers to help the company meet their AI needs and their sustainability goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nuclear news focuses on small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), factory-built, modular power plants that could be installed near data centers, potentially without the cost overruns and delays often experienced in building large plants. Google recently ordered a fleet of SMRs to generate the power needed by its data centers. The first one will be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hyperscalers are betting on new technologies. For example, Google is pursuing next-generation geothermal projects, and Microsoft has signed a contract to purchase electricity from a startup’s fusion power plant beginning in 2028 — even though the fusion technology hasn’t yet been demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing electricity demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches to providing sufficient clean electricity focus on making the data center and the operations it houses more energy efficient so as to perform the same computing tasks using less power. Using faster computer chips and optimizing algorithms that use less energy are already helping to reduce the load, and also the heat generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea being tried involves shifting computing tasks to times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid. Deka explains: “If a task doesn’t have to be completed immediately, but rather by a certain deadline, can it be delayed or moved to a data center elsewhere in the U.S. or overseas where electricity is more abundant, cheaper, and/or cleaner? This approach is known as ‘carbon-aware computing.’” We’re not yet sure whether every task can be moved or delayed easily, says Deka. “If you think of a generative AI-based task, can it easily be separated into small tasks that can be taken to different parts of the country, solved using clean energy, and then be brought back together? What is the cost of doing this kind of division of tasks?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach is, of course, limited by the problem of the interconnection queue. It’s difficult to access clean energy in another region or state. But efforts are under way to ease the regulatory framework to make sure that critical interconnections can be developed more quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the neighbors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major concern running through all the options for powering data centers is the impact on residential energy consumers. When a data center comes into a neighborhood, there are not only aesthetic concerns but also more practical worries. Will the local electricity service become less reliable? Where will the new transmission lines be located? And who will pay for the new generators, upgrades to existing equipment, and so on? When new manufacturing facilities or industrial plants go into a neighborhood, the downsides are generally offset by the availability of new jobs. Not so with a data center, which may require just a couple dozen employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are standard rules about how maintenance and upgrade costs are shared and allocated. But the situation is totally changed by the presence of a new data center. As a result, utilities now need to rethink their traditional rate structures so as not to place an undue burden on residents to pay for the infrastructure changes needed to host data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT’s contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, researchers are thinking about and exploring a range of options for tackling the problem of providing clean power to data centers. For example, they are investigating architectural designs that will use natural ventilation to facilitate cooling, equipment layouts that will permit better airflow and power distribution, and highly energy-efficient air conditioning systems based on novel materials. They are creating new analytical tools for evaluating the impact of data center deployments on the U.S. power system and for finding the most efficient ways to provide the facilities with clean energy. Other work looks at how to match the output of small nuclear reactors to the needs of a data center, and how to speed up the construction of such reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT teams also focus on determining the best sources of backup power and long-duration storage, and on developing decision support systems for locating proposed new data centers, taking into account the availability of electric power and water and also regulatory considerations, and even the potential for using what can be significant waste heat, for example, for heating nearby buildings. Technology development projects include designing faster, more efficient computer chips and more energy-efficient computing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing leadership and funding for many research projects, MITEI is acting as a convenor, bringing together companies and stakeholders to address this issue.&amp;nbsp;At MITEI’s 2024 Annual Research Conference, a panel of representatives from&amp;nbsp;two hyperscalers and two companies that design and construct data centers together discussed their challenges, possible solutions, and where MIT research could be most beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As data centers continue to be built, and computing continues to create an unprecedented increase in demand for electricity, Green says, scientists and engineers are in a race to provide the ideas, innovations, and technologies that can meet this need, and at the same time continue to advance the transition to a decarbonized energy system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>David L. Chandler | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ammonia is the most widely produced chemical in the world today, used primarily as a source for nitrogen fertilizer. Its production is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions — the highest in the whole chemical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of researchers at MIT has developed an innovative way of making ammonia without the usual fossil-fuel-powered chemical plants that require high heat and pressure. Instead, they have found a way to use the Earth itself as a geochemical reactor, producing ammonia underground. The processes uses Earth’s naturally occurring heat and pressure, provided free of charge and free of emissions, as well as the reactivity of minerals already present in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick the team devised is to inject water underground, into an area of iron-rich subsurface rock. The water carries with it a source of nitrogen and particles of a metal catalyst, allowing the water to react with the iron to generate clean hydrogen, which in turn reacts with the nitrogen to make ammonia. A second well is then used to pump that ammonia up to the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process, which has been demonstrated in the lab but not yet in a natural setting, is &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(24)00541-5" target="_blank"&gt;described today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Joule&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s co-authors are MIT professors of materials science and engineering Iwnetim Abate and Ju Li, postdoc Yifan Gao, and five others at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first produced ammonia from rock in the lab, I was so excited,” Gao recalls. “I realized this represented an entirely new and never-reported approach to ammonia synthesis.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard method for making ammonia is called the Haber-Bosch process, which was developed in Germany in the early 20th century to replace natural sources of nitrogen fertilizer such as mined deposits of bat guano, which were becoming depleted. But the Haber-Bosch process is very energy intensive: It requires temperatures of 400 degrees Celsius and pressures of 200 atmospheres, and this means it needs huge installations in order to be efficient. Some areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, have few or no such plants in operation.&amp;nbsp; As a result, the shortage or extremely high cost of fertilizer in these regions has limited their agricultural production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Haber-Bosch process “is good. It works,” Abate says. “Without it, we wouldn’t have been able to feed 2 out of the total 8 billion people in the world right now, he says, referring to the portion of the world’s population whose food is grown with ammonia-based fertilizers. But because of the emissions and energy demands, a better process is needed, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burning fuel to generate heat is responsible for about 20 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted from plants using the Haber-Bosch process. Making hydrogen accounts for the remaining 80 percent.&amp;nbsp; But ammonia, the molecule NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is made up only of nitrogen and hydrogen. There’s no carbon in the formula, so where do the carbon emissions come from? The standard way of producing the needed hydrogen is by processing methane gas with steam, breaking down the gas into pure hydrogen, which gets used, and carbon dioxide gas that gets released into the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other processes exist for making low- or no-emissions hydrogen, such as by using solar or wind-generated electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, but that process can be expensive. That’s why Abate and his team worked on developing a system to produce what they call geological hydrogen. Some places in the world, including some in Africa, have been found to naturally generate hydrogen underground through chemical reactions between water and iron-rich rocks. These pockets of naturally occurring hydrogen can be mined, just like natural methane reservoirs, but the extent and locations of such deposits are still relatively unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abate realized this process could be created or enhanced by pumping water, laced with copper and nickel catalyst particles to speed up the process, into the ground in places where such iron-rich rocks were already present. “We can use the Earth as a factory to produce clean flows of hydrogen,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalls thinking about the problem of the emissions from hydrogen production for ammonia: “The ‘aha!’ moment for me was thinking, how about we link this process of geological hydrogen production with the process of making Haber-Bosch ammonia?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would solve the biggest problem of the underground hydrogen production process, which is how to capture and store the gas once it’s produced. Hydrogen is a very tiny molecule — the smallest of them all — and hard to contain. But by implementing the entire Haber-Bosch process underground, the only material that would need to be sent to the surface would be the ammonia itself, which is easy to capture, store, and transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only extra ingredient needed to complete the process was the addition of a source of nitrogen, such as nitrate or nitrogen gas, into the water-catalyst mixture being injected into the ground. Then, as the hydrogen gets released from water molecules after interacting with the iron-rich rocks, it can immediately bond with the nitrogen atoms also carried in the water, with the deep underground environment providing the high temperatures and pressures required by the Haber-Bosch process. A second well near the injection well then pumps the ammonia out and into tanks on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We call this geological ammonia,” Abate says, “because we are using subsurface temperature, pressure, chemistry, and geologically existing rocks to produce ammonia directly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas transporting hydrogen requires expensive equipment to cool and liquefy it, and virtually no pipelines exist for its transport (except near oil refinery sites), transporting ammonia is easier and cheaper. It’s about one-sixth the cost of transporting hydrogen, and there are already more than 5,000 miles of ammonia pipelines and 10,000 terminals in place in the U.S. alone. What’s more, Abate explains, ammonia, unlike hydrogen, already has a substantial commercial market in place, with&amp;nbsp;production volume projected to grow by two to three times by 2050, as it is used not only for fertilizer but also as feedstock for a wide variety of chemical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, ammonia can be burned directly in gas turbines, engines, and industrial furnaces, providing a carbon-free alternative to fossil fuels. It is being explored for maritime shipping and aviation as an alternative fuel, and as a possible space propellant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another upside to geological ammonia is that untreated wastewater, including agricultural runoff, which tends to be rich in nitrogen already, could serve as the water source and be treated in the process. “We can tackle the problem of treating wastewater, while also making something of value out of this waste,” Abate says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gao adds that this process “involves no direct carbon emissions, presenting a potential pathway to reduce global CO2 emissions by up to 1 percent.” To arrive at this point, he says, the team “overcame numerous challenges and learned from many failed attempts. For example, we tested a wide range of conditions and catalysts before identifying the most effective one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was seed-funded under a flagship project of MIT’s Climate Grand Challenges program, the Center for the Electrification and Decarbonization of Industry. Professor Yet-Ming Chiang, co-director of the center, says “I don’t think there’s been any previous example of deliberately using the Earth as a chemical reactor. That’s one of the key novel points of this approach.”&amp;nbsp; Chiang emphasizes that even though it is a geological process, it happens very fast, not on geological timescales. “The reaction is fundamentally over in a matter of hours,” he says. “The reaction is so fast that this answers one of the key questions: Do you have to wait for geological times? And the answer is absolutely no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Elsa Olivetti, a mission director of the newly established Climate Project at MIT, says, “The creative thinking by this team is invaluable to MIT’s ability to have impact at scale. Coupling these exciting results with, for example, advanced understanding of the geology surrounding hydrogen accumulations represent the whole-of-Institute efforts the Climate Project aims to support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a significant breakthrough for the future of sustainable development,” says Geoffrey Ellis, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, who was not associated with this work. He adds, “While there is clearly more work that needs to be done to validate this at the pilot stage and to get this to the commercial scale, the concept that has been demonstrated is truly transformative.&amp;nbsp; The approach of engineering a system to optimize the natural process of nitrate reduction by Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is ingenious and will likely lead to further innovations along these lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial work on the process has been done in the laboratory, so the next step will be to prove the process using a real underground site. “We think that kind of experiment can be done within the next one to two years,” Abate says. This could open doors to using a similar approach for other chemical production processes, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has applied for a patent and aims to work towards bringing the process to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving forward,” Gao says, “our focus will be on optimizing the process conditions and scaling up tests, with the goal of enabling practical applications for geological ammonia in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also included Ming Lei, Bachu Sravan Kumar, Hugh Smith, Seok Hee Han, and Lokesh Sangabattula, all at MIT. Additional funding was provided by the National Science Foundation and was carried out, in part, through the use of MIT.nano facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a two-part series,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; explores the environmental implications of generative AI. In this article, we look at why this technology is so resource-intensive. A second piece will investigate what experts are doing to reduce genAI’s carbon footprint and other impacts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excitement surrounding potential benefits of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-generative-ai-1109" target="_blank"&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt;, from improving worker productivity to advancing scientific research, is hard to ignore. While the explosive growth of this new technology has enabled rapid deployment of powerful models in many industries, the environmental consequences of this generative AI “gold rush” remain difficult to pin down, let alone mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computational power required to train generative AI models that often have billions of parameters, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, can demand a staggering amount of electricity, which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions and pressures on the electric grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, deploying these models in real-world applications, enabling millions to use generative AI in their daily lives, and then fine-tuning the models to improve their performance draws large amounts of energy long after a model has been developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond electricity demands, a great deal of water is needed to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems. The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we think about the environmental impact of generative AI, it is not just the electricity you consume when you plug the computer in. There are much broader consequences that go out to a system level and persist based on actions that we take,” says Elsa A. Olivetti, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and the lead of the Decarbonization Mission of MIT’s new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Climate Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivetti is senior author of a 2024 paper, “&lt;a href="https://mit-genai.pubpub.org/pub/8ulgrckc/release/2" target="_blank"&gt;The Climate and Sustainability Implications of Generative AI&lt;/a&gt;,” co-authored by MIT colleagues in response to an Institute-wide call for papers that explore the transformative potential of generative AI, in both positive and negative directions for society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demanding data centers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The electricity demands of data centers are one major factor contributing to the environmental impacts of generative AI, since data centers are used to train and run the deep learning models behind popular tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A data center is a temperature-controlled building that houses computing infrastructure, such as servers, data storage drives, and network equipment. For instance, Amazon has more than&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/" target="_blank"&gt;100 data centers worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, each of which has about 50,000 servers that the company uses to support cloud computing services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While data centers have been around since the 1940s (the first was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1945 to support the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/about/history-heritage/eniac/" target="_blank"&gt;first general-purpose digital computer&lt;/a&gt;, the ENIAC), the rise of generative AI has dramatically increased the pace of data center construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is different about generative AI is the power density it requires. Fundamentally, it is just computing, but a generative AI training cluster might consume seven or eight times more energy than a typical computing workload,” says Noman Bashir, lead author of the impact paper, who is a Computing and Climate Impact Fellow at MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC) and a postdoc in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have estimated that the power requirements of data centers in North America increased from 2,688 megawatts at the end of 2022 to 5,341 megawatts at the end of 2023, partly driven by the demands of generative AI. Globally, the electricity consumption of data centers rose to 460 terawatts in 2022. This would have made data centers the 11th largest electricity consumer in the world, between the nations of Saudi Arabia (371 terawatts) and France (463 terawatts), according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2026, the electricity consumption of data centers is expected to approach 1,050 terawatts (which would bump data centers up to fifth place on the global list, between Japan and Russia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not all data center computation involves generative AI, the technology has been a major driver of increasing energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The demand for new data centers cannot be met in a sustainable way. The pace at which companies are building new data centers means the bulk of the electricity to power them must come from fossil fuel-based power plants,” says Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power needed to train and deploy a model like OpenAI’s GPT-3 is difficult to ascertain. In a 2021 research paper, scientists from Google and the University of California at Berkeley estimated the training process alone consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity (enough to power about 120 average U.S. homes for a year), generating about 552 tons of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all machine-learning models must be trained, one issue unique to generative AI is the rapid fluctuations in energy use that occur over different phases of the training process, Bashir explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power grid operators must have a way to absorb those fluctuations to protect the grid, and they usually employ&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nrg.com/insights/energy-education/generation.html#:~:text=Peaking%20power,-When%20demand%20increases&amp;amp;text=Most%20often%20these%20peaks%20occur,basis%20to%20ensure%20system%20reliability." target="_blank"&gt;diesel-based generators&lt;/a&gt; for that task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing impacts from inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a generative AI model is trained, the energy demands don’t disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time a model is used, perhaps by an individual asking ChatGPT to summarize an email, the computing hardware that performs those operations consumes energy. Researchers have estimated that a ChatGPT query consumes about five times more electricity than a simple web search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But an everyday user doesn’t think too much about that,” says Bashir. “The ease-of-use of generative AI interfaces and the lack of information about the environmental impacts of my actions means that, as a user, I don’t have much incentive to cut back on my use of generative AI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With traditional AI, the energy usage is split fairly evenly between data processing, model training, and inference, which is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. However, Bashir expects the electricity demands of generative AI inference to eventually dominate since these models are becoming ubiquitous in so many applications, and the electricity needed for inference will increase as future versions of the models become larger and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, generative AI models have an especially short shelf-life, driven by rising demand for new AI applications. Companies release new models every few weeks, so the energy used to train prior versions goes to waste, Bashir adds. New models often consume more energy for training, since they usually have more parameters than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While electricity demands of data centers may be getting the most attention in research literature, the amount of water consumed by these facilities has environmental impacts, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chilled water is used to cool a data center by absorbing heat from computing equipment. It has been estimated that, for each kilowatt hour of energy a data center consumes, it would need two liters of water for cooling, says Bashir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because this is called ‘cloud computing’ doesn’t mean the hardware lives in the cloud. Data centers are present in our physical world, and because of their water usage they have direct and indirect implications for biodiversity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computing hardware inside data centers brings its own, less direct environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is difficult to estimate how much power is needed to manufacture a GPU, a type of powerful processor that can handle intensive generative AI workloads, it would be more than what is needed to produce a simpler CPU because the fabrication process is more complex. A GPU’s carbon footprint is compounded by the emissions related to material and product transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also environmental implications of obtaining the raw materials used to fabricate GPUs, which can involve dirty mining procedures and the use of toxic chemicals for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research firm TechInsights estimates that the three major producers (NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel) shipped 3.85 million GPUs to data centers in 2023, up from about 2.67 million in 2022. That number is expected to have increased by an even greater percentage in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is on an unsustainable path, but there are ways to encourage responsible development of generative AI that supports environmental objectives, Bashir says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He, Olivetti, and their MIT colleagues argue that this will require a comprehensive consideration of all the environmental and societal costs of generative AI, as well as a detailed assessment of the value in its perceived benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need a more contextual way of systematically and comprehensively understanding the implications of new developments in this space. Due to the speed at which there have been improvements, we haven’t had a chance to catch up with our abilities to measure and understand the tradeoffs,” Olivetti says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many people around the globe are living in energy poverty, meaning they spend at least 8 percent of their annual household income on energy. Addressing this problem is not simple, but an experiment by MIT researchers shows that giving people better data about their energy use, plus some coaching on the subject, can lead them to substantially reduce their consumption and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment, based in Amsterdam, resulted in households cutting their energy expenses in half, on aggregate — a savings big enough to move three-quarters of them out of energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our energy coaching project as a whole showed a 75 percent success rate at alleviating energy poverty,” says Joseph Llewellyn, a researcher with MIT’s Senseable City Lab and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the experiment’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Energy poverty afflicts families all over the world. With empirical evidence on which policies work, governments could focus their efforts more effectively,” says Fábio Duarte, associate director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab, and another co-author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80773-9" target="_blank"&gt;Assessing the impact of energy coaching with smart technology interventions to alleviate energy poverty&lt;/a&gt;,” appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are Llewellyn, who is also a researcher at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) and the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm; Titus Venverloo, a research fellow at the MIT Senseable City Lab and AMS; Fábio Duarte, who is also a principal researcher MIT’s Senseable City Lab; Carlo Ratti, director of the Senseable City Lab; and Cecilia Katzeff, Fredrik Johansson, and Daniel Pargman&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed the study after engaging with city officials in Amsterdam. In the Netherlands, about 550,000 households, or 7 percent of the population, are considered to be in energy poverty; in the European Union, that figure is about 50 million. In the U.S., separate research has shown that about three in 10 households report trouble paying energy bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the experiment, the researchers ran two versions of an energy coaching intervention. In one version, 67 households received one report on their energy usage, along with coaching about how to increase energy efficiency. In the other version, 50 households received those things as well as a smart device giving them real-time updates on their energy consumption. (All households also received some modest energy-savings improvements at the outset, such as additional insulation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the two groups, homes typically reduced monthly consumption of electricity by 33 percent and gas by 42 percent. They lowered their bills by 53 percent, on aggregate, and the percentage of income they spent on energy dropped from 10.1 percent to 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What were these households doing differently? Some of the biggest behavioral changes included things such as only heating rooms that were in use and unplugging devices not being used. Both of those changes save energy, but their benefits were not always understood by residents before they received energy coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The range of energy literacy was quite wide from one home to the next,” Llewellyn says. “And when I went somewhere as an energy coach, it was never to moralize about energy use. I never said, ‘Oh, you’re using way too much.’ It was always working on it with the households, depending on what people need for their homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the homes receiving the small devices that displayed real-time energy data only tended to use them for three or four weeks following a coaching visit. After that, people seemed to lose interest in very frequent monitoring of their energy use. And yet, a few weeks of consulting the devices tended to be long enough to get people to change their habits in a lasting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that smart devices need to be accompanied by a close understanding of what drives families to change their behaviors,” Venverloo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers acknowledge, working with consumers to reduce their energy consumption is just one way to help people escape energy poverty. Other “structural” factors that can help include lower energy prices and more energy-efficient buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the latter note, the current paper has given rise to a new experiment Llewellyn is developing with Amsterdam officials, to examine the benefits of retrofitting residental buildings to lower energy costs. In that case, local policymakers are trying to work out how to fund the retrofitting in such a way that landlords do not simply pass those costs on to tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want a household to save money on their energy bills if it also means the rent increases, because then we’ve just displaced expenses from one item to another,” Llewellyn says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Households can also invest in products like better insulation themselves, for windows or heating components, although for low-income households, finding the money to pay for such things may not be trivial. That is especially the case, Llewellyn suggests, because energy costs can seem “invisible,” and a lower priority, than feeding and clothing a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big upfront cost for a household that does not have 100 Euros to spend,” Llewellyn says. Compared to paying for other necessities, he notes, “Energy is often the thing that tends to fall last on their list. Energy is always going to be this invisible thing that hides behind the walls, and it’s not easy to change that.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[By developing new materials for separating a mixture’s components, Zachary Smith hopes to reduce costs and environmental impact across many U.S. industries.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For many industrial processes, the typical way to separate gases, liquids, or ions is with heat, using slight differences in boiling points to purify mixtures. These thermal processes account for roughly 10 percent of the energy use in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT chemical engineer Zachary Smith wants to reduce costs and carbon footprints by replacing these energy-intensive processes with highly efficient filters that can separate gases, liquids, and ions at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his lab at MIT, Smith is designing membranes with tiny pores that can filter tiny molecules based on their size. These membranes could be useful for purifying biogas, capturing carbon dioxide from power plant emissions, or generating hydrogen fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re taking materials that have unique capabilities for separating molecules and ions with precision, and applying them to applications where the current processes are not efficient, and where there’s an enormous carbon footprint,” says Smith, an associate professor of chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and several former students have founded a company called Osmoses that is working toward developing these materials for large-scale use in gas purification. Removing the need for high temperatures in these widespread industrial processes could have a significant impact on energy consumption, potentially reducing it by as much as 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see a world where we could eliminate thermal separations, and where heat is no longer a problem in creating the things that we need and producing the energy that we need,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hooked on research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a high school student, Smith was drawn to engineering but didn’t have many engineering role models. Both of his parents were physicians, and they always encouraged him to work hard in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up without knowing many engineers, and certainly no chemical engineers. But I knew that I really liked seeing how the world worked. I was always fascinated by chemistry and seeing how mathematics helped to explain this area of science,” recalls Smith, who grew up near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. “Chemical engineering seemed to have all those things built into it, but I really had no idea what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Penn State University, Smith worked with a professor named Henry “Hank” Foley on a research project designing carbon-based materials to create a “molecular sieve” for gas separation. Through a time-consuming and iterative layering process, he created a sieve that could purify oxygen and nitrogen from air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I kept adding more and more coatings of a special material that I could subsequently carbonize, and eventually I started to get selectivity. In the end, I had made a membrane that could sieve molecules that only differed by 0.18 angstrom in size,” he says. “I got hooked on research at that point, and that’s what led me to do more things in the area of membranes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from college in 2008, Smith pursued graduate studies in chemical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. There, he continued developing membranes for gas separation, this time using a different class of materials — polymers. By controlling polymer structure, he was able to create films with pores that filter out specific molecules, such as carbon dioxide or other gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polymers are a type of material that you can actually form into big devices that can integrate into world-class chemical plants. So, it was exciting to see that there was a scalable class of materials that could have a real impact on addressing questions related to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other energy-efficient separations,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing his PhD, he decided he wanted to learn more chemistry, which led him to a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to learn how to make my own molecules and materials. I wanted to run my own reactions and do it in a more systematic way,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Berkeley, he learned how make compounds called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) — cage-like molecules that have potential applications in gas separation and many other fields. He also realized that while he enjoyed chemistry, he was definitely a chemical engineer at heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned a ton when I was there, but I also learned a lot about myself,” he says. “As much as I love chemistry, work with chemists, and advise chemists in my own group, I’m definitely a chemical engineer, really focused on the process and application.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving global problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While interviewing for faculty jobs, Smith found himself drawn to MIT because of the mindset of the people he met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I began to realize not only how talented the faculty and the students were, but the way they thought was very different than other places I had been,” he says. “It wasn’t just about doing something that would move their field a little bit forward. They were actually creating new fields. There was something inspirational about the type of people that ended up at MIT who wanted to solve global problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his lab at MIT, Smith is now tackling some of those global problems, including water purification, critical element recovery, renewable energy, battery development, and carbon sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a close collaboration with Yan Xia, a professor at Stanford University, Smith recently developed gas separation membranes that incorporate a novel type of polymer known as “&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/membrane-separate-gases-0325" target="_blank"&gt;ladder polymers&lt;/a&gt;,” which are currently being scaled for deployment at his startup. Historically, using polymers for gas separation has been limited by a tradeoff between permeability and selectivity — that is, membranes that permit a faster flow of gases through the membrane tend to be less selective, allowing impurities to get through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using ladder polymers, which consist of double strands connected by rung-like bonds, the researchers were able to create gas separation membranes that are both highly permeable and very selective. The boost in permeability — a 100- to 1,000-fold improvement over earlier materials — could enable membranes to replace some of the high-energy techniques now used to separate gases, Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allows you to envision large-scale industrial problems solved with miniaturized devices,” he says. “If you can really shrink down the system, then the solutions we’re developing in the lab could easily be applied to big industries like the chemicals industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments and others have been part of a number of advancements made by collaborators, students, postdocs, and researchers who are part of Smith’s team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a great research team of talented and hard-working students and postdocs, and I get to teach on topics that have been instrumental in my own professional career,” Smith says. “MIT has been a playground to explore and learn new things. I am excited for what my team will discover next, and grateful for an opportunity to help solve many important global problems.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
